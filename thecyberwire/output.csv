Offenders could face up to three years in prison, plus fines. The law also requires social media companies to set up processes to remove NCII within 48 hours of being alerted.
The bill unanimously cleared the Senate in February and passed the House 409–2 in April. POLITICO notes that many industry and victim advocate groups support the bill, though some digital rights organizations worry the law could be misused for censorship."

The company said in a statement, ""We can confirm that we have identified suspicious activity at our dairy site in Upahl that impacted the local IT network. Due to the safety measures initiated as a result of the incident, production was temporarily affected....Since then, we've been working diligently to restore full operations. We expect to return to normal operations at the site in the next few days. Production at other Arla sites is not affected.""
The company didn't share details about the nature of the attack, and BleepingComputer notes that so far no criminal groups have taken credit."

The company's managing director Tom Binks told the BBC, ""The transport activities of the business have continued unaffected throughout this incident.""
The incident follows similar attacks against UK stores Marks & Spencer, Co-op, and Harrods. Industry sources note that the grocery sector is particularly vulnerable to ransomware because distribution and delivery are time-sensitive."

The BBC notes that the breach ""covers all areas of the aid system - including domestic abuse victims, those in family cases and others facing criminal prosecution.""
According to the Guardian, British authorities believe the hack was carried out by a criminal gang, not a state-sponsored actor."

Council pleaded guilty to his role in carrying out a SIM swapping attack against the mobile phone account associated with the SEC's X account. One of his co-conspirators then used the account to make a fraudulent post that temporarily spiked the price of Bitcoin.
The Justice Department stated, ""Council, aka 'Ronin' and 'Agiantschnauzer,' was arrested Oct. 17, 2024, and admitted to receiving about $50,000 to perform SIM swap. He pleaded guilty Feb. 10, 2025, in the District of Columbia to conspiracy to commit aggravated identity theft. In addition to the prison term, U.S. District Court Judge Amy Berman Jackson ordered forfeiture of $50,000 and three years of supervised release with the condition that he not use computers to access the dark web or commit further identity fraud."""

The incident disrupted grocery resupplies at some stores, leaving food shelves empty. The company says deliveries are back to normal, and stores should be better-stocked this weekend.

The defendants are accused of various activities related to cryptocurrency theft, including carrying out physical burglaries to steal hardware wallets. Several of the suspects were arrested in California this week, while two are believed to be living abroad in Dubai.
The Justice Department stated, ""The various roles included database hackers, organizers, target identifiers, callers, money launderers, and residential burglars targeting hardware virtual currency wallets. Database hackers hacked websites and servers to obtain cryptocurrency-related databases or purchased databases on the darkweb. Organizers and target identifiers organized and collated information across the databases to determine the most valuable targets. Callers cold-called victims and used social engineering to convince them their accounts were the subject of cyberattacks and the enterprise callers were attempting to help secure their accounts. Money launderers received the stolen crypto currency and turned it into fiat U.S. currency in the form of bulk cash or wire transfers."""

A vulnerability affecting MDaemon (CVE-2024-11182), which has since been patched, was exploited as a zero-day. The researchers attribute the campaign with medium confidence to Sednit (also known as ""APT28"" or ""Fancy Bear""), a threat actor associated with Russia's GRU.
The majority of the victims were ""governmental entities and defense companies in Eastern Europe,"" although attacks were also observed against governments in Africa, Europe, and South America. The malware strains used in the campaign are designed ""to steal webmail credentials, and exfiltrate contacts and email messages from the victim’s mailbox."""

The vulnerability is an insufficient policy enforcement that can allow ""a remote attacker to leak cross-origin data via a crafted HTML page."" It's not clear if the flaw is under active exploitation, but Google says it's ""aware of reports that an exploit for CVE-2025-4664 exists in the wild.""
Solidlab security researcher Vsevolod Kokorin, who discovered the flaw, explained in an X post, ""[U]nlike other browsers, Chrome resolves the Link header on subresource requests. But what's the problem? The issue is that the Link header can set a referrer-policy. We can specify unsafe-url and capture the full query parameters. Query parameters can contain sensitive data - for example, in OAuth flows, this might lead to an Account Takeover. Developers rarely consider the possibility of stealing query parameters via an image from a 3rd-party resource."""

The company refused to pay a $20 million ransom demand, and is instead offering $20 million for information leading to the arrest of the crooks.
Coinbase stated, ""Cyber criminals bribed and recruited a group of rogue overseas support agents to steal Coinbase customer data to facilitate social engineering attacks. These insiders abused their access to customer support systems to steal the account data for a small subset of customers. No passwords, private keys, or funds were exposed and Coinbase Prime accounts are untouched. We will reimburse customers who were tricked into sending funds to the attacker.""
Coinbase Chief Security Officer Philip Martin told Fortune that the bribed workers, who were located in India, have been fired."

The malware is using AutoIt-compiled executables as a dropper component, which helps the malware evade detection. Unit 42 notes, ""The compression and encryption prevent easy decompilation of the bytecode. The compiled AutoIt binary handles the decompression of the bytecode before interpreting and executing it.""
The latest DarkCloud Stealer campaign is targeting a wide range of industries, with a notable focus on federal, state, and local government entities."
